Async Website
=============

Welcome to the repository for the Async website. The site a [Jekyll][#jekyll]
website hosted by [GitHub pages][#gh-pages]. This just means this repository
contains templates and assets that are converted into a static HTML site each
time a commit is pushed to GitHub.

Running the server locally
--------------------------

You'll need **ruby** and **bundler** installed locally. The [GitHub pages
documentation][#gh-docs] will take you through this. Once done you can install
Jekyll by running:

    $ bundle install

Then to start the server run the following from the project directory:

    $ make serve

Then visit <http://localhost:4000/> in the browser. This writes out the site
files into the **/tmp/asyncjs** directory (apols to Windows users).

Creating a new event
--------------------

To create a new post you'll need to create a new file in the __posts_
directory. This should be named `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the
date of the event, `slug` is the page slug and `.md` is the formatter.

There is a helpful `make` task for creating a new event file. Just run the
following from the project directory:

    $ make post

The top part of the post is meta data that is used to build the site the second
part after the second `---` is the post body. This should be formatted with
[markdown][#md].

### Metadata

There is quite a bit of metadata that can be added to a post. It's formatted
in [YAML][#yaml] and here's an overview of what it all means.

    ---
    number:    The number of the event in the series.
    title:     The title of the event.
    summary:   A short one-liner for the event. Markdown is allowed.
    date:      A ISO8601 formatted string for the date and time of the event.
    lanyrd:    The url to the lanyrd page for the event.
    speakers:  An array of speakers
    - name:    Speaker name
      link:    Speaker website or twitter account.
    sponsors:  An array of sponsors.

Creating a blog post
--------------------

A blog post is created in the same way as an event entry but the date in
the filename should be the published date. For a blog post the metadata is
much simpler:

    ---
    title:     The title of the blog post
    authors:   An array of authors
    - name:    The authors name.
      link:    The authors website.
    category:  news
    layout:    news
    published: true
    ---

Triggering a site rebuild, without new content
----------------------------------------------

GitHub pages rebuilds the site whenever a new commit is made. If a re-build is
required, even without new content - e.g. in order to re-render the 'next event'
on the home page, then run the following:

    git commit --allow-empty -m "Republish GitHub pages (empty commit)"
    git push
