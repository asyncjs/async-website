    <h2 class="module-heading">Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetup are
      required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will
      enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all
      participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading">The Quick Version</h3>
    <p>
      Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience
      for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
      sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
      ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not
      tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language
      and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks,
      workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Meetup participants
      violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup at the
      discretion of the meetup organisers.
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading">The Less Quick Version</h3>
    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
      identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
      appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices,
      sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
      following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
      talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
      sexual attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
      sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
      Any staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
      clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organisers may
      take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
      expulsion from the meetup with no refund.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
      have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately.

      experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We
      value your attendance.

      and meetup-related social events.
