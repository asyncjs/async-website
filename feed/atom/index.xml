The aim is to create a friendly environment for everyone to ask their <em>&quot;that thing you&#39;ve never understood but always been too afraid to ask&quot;</em> type questions, plus any other topics you feel like talking about on the night.</p>
<p>We will be asking/talking/rambling about everything web-related - 5-10 minutes per topic, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabs or spaces for indentation?</li>
<li>Is it okay to use &quot;!important&quot; in CSS?</li>
<li>Is it better to have a light or dark theme for your IDE?</li>
<li>Should you write comments in your code, or is it better to write self-documenting code?</li>
<li>Should you use &quot;camelCase&quot; or &quot;snake_case&quot; for variable names in your code?</li>
<li>Is it better to use single or double quotes in JavaScript?</li>
<li>Is it &quot;gif&quot; or &quot;jif&quot;?</li>
<li>Vim or Emacs?</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be able to submit topics with event attendees voting for the topics they would like to discuss. We will run the discussion for about an hour after which you have the option to retire to a local brewery to discuss the night away.</p>
<p>The format works best when there is a diverse group of people and opinions in the room, so whether you consider yourself an absolute beginner or a seasoned pro, do come and join.</p>
<p>Put your thinking caps on and start thinking of some questions you would like to ask!</p>

Would you like to get back to the good old days of server-rendered applications, but worried that you&#39;ll lose responsiveness and interactivity?</p>
<p>Tools like HTMX, Hotwire and Livewire represent a new paradigm for creating web applications. They let you build simple but powerful apps, using the bare minimum of client-side JavaScript, and building on the strengths of the browser.</p>
<p>Expect a brief but ill-informed overview of the history of web development, a demonstration of what these new tools can do and thoughts on whether they might be right for your next project.</p>

The aim is to create a friendly environment for everyone to ask their <em>&quot;that thing you&#39;ve never understood but always been too afraid to ask&quot;</em> type questions, plus any other topics you feel like talking about on the night.</p>
<p>Inspired by the monthly Brighton <a href="http://brightonalt.net/">ALT.NET meetup</a>, we will be asking/talking/rambling about everything web-related - 5-10 minutes per topic, such as (thanks ChatGPT):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabs or spaces for indentation?</li>
<li>Is it okay to use &quot;!important&quot; in CSS?</li>
<li>Is it better to have a light or dark theme for your IDE?</li>
<li>Should you write comments in your code, or is it better to write self-documenting code?</li>
<li>Should you use &quot;camelCase&quot; or &quot;snake_case&quot; for variable names in your code?</li>
<li>Is it better to use single or double quotes in JavaScript?</li>
<li>Is it &quot;gif&quot; or &quot;jif&quot;?</li>
<li>Vim or Emacs?</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be able to submit topics, and event attendees will be able to vote for the topics they would like to discuss. We will run the discussion for about an hour, and afterwards, anyone who wishes can join us nearby for a chat/drink.</p>
<p>The format works best when there is a diverse group of people and opinions in the room, so whether you consider yourself an absolute beginner or a seasoned pro, do come and join.</p>
<p>Put your thinking caps on and start thinking of some questions you would like to ask!</p>

Historically the methods used have been largely file based, with EDF needing to share the data internally between many different systems for many different needs.</p>
<p>De-regulation, a more competitive energy market, a rising cost to serve energy and changes to industry processes has meant EDF needs to find ways to drive it&#39;s cost to serve down and stay competitive.</p>
<p>Event Driven Architecture is increasingly becoming the tool that EDF is choosing to manage the complexity of these energy interactions and solve these problems.</p>
<p>Kevin Baldwyn is a lead engineer at EDF energy and in this talk he will explain how EDF is using EDA to manage the complexity of UK Energy Interactions and describe some of the architecture, patterns, lessons learned, and why you may want to start using EDA in your applications.</p>

<p>This is the tale of how Alexa, with a little bit of help, came to the rescue of a blind person who could not get access to local news.</p>
<p>In this talk, Alex Nicol speaks about accessibility, web crawling, tech-for-good, Alexa, running Ruby on Lambdas, and working on a side project whilst having a six-month-old baby.</p>
<p>Alex Nicol is a web developer working at <a href="https://bridge-u.com/">BridgeU</a> and <a href="https://www.bouncetechnologies.com/">Bounce Technologies</a>. He&#39;s also founded his <a href="https://alexnicol.dev">own consultancy company</a>, specialised in conversational systems and tech-for-good.

Join us as we wind down for 2022’s final first-Thursday-of-the-month in festive December, and we reflect on another fabulous and varied year of Async meetups. This year join us in-person or follow along online.</p>
<p>As with previous years, this won’t be a test of how much JavaScript you know. It’s more like a traditional pub quiz that promises to be humbling at any stage of your career. Come one, come all for this earnest contest for the ultimate prize of trivial knowledge!</p>

You’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web.</p>
<p>If you would like to grab a speaking slot, please leave a comment on the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/async-web-tech-meetup/events/289172125/">meetup event</a> including:</p>

The catch - you have to write as little JavaScript as possible. Solve each challenge in the least number of characters to win the game. Imagine the kind of stuff you’d never want to see make it into a real codebase… that’s what we’re looking for!</p>
<p>We are making an effort to ensure that this episode of JavaScript Golf will be suitable for people of all skill levels, so even if you’re reasonably new to JavaScript you should still be able to tackle the challenges (and we’ll be on hand to help if you need it!). Even if you don’t get the fewest number of characters we hope that the majority of attendees will learn a little something about JavaScript from each other along the way. So, don’t forget to bring your laptop, tablet, phone, or whatever you feel comfortable writing code on (with a text editor installed).</p>
<p>As always we welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you&#39;ve got a few years under your belt, or you&#39;re just starting to look into development we&#39;d love to have you along.</p>
<p>You will be able to join us in-person at <a href="https://www.spacesworks.com/brighton/trafalgar-place/">Spaces</a>, or online (via Zoom).</p>
