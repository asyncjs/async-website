The aim is to create a friendly environment for everyone to ask their <em>&quot;that thing you&#39;ve never understood but always been too afraid to ask&quot;</em> type questions, plus any other topics you feel like talking about on the night.</p>
<p>Inspired by the monthly Brighton <a href="http://brightonalt.net/">ALT.NET meetup</a>, we will be asking/talking/rambling about everything web-related - 5-10 minutes per topic, such as (thanks ChatGPT):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabs or spaces for indentation?</li>
<li>Is it okay to use &quot;!important&quot; in CSS?</li>
<li>Is it better to have a light or dark theme for your IDE?</li>
<li>Should you write comments in your code, or is it better to write self-documenting code?</li>
<li>Should you use &quot;camelCase&quot; or &quot;snake_case&quot; for variable names in your code?</li>
<li>Is it better to use single or double quotes in JavaScript?</li>
<li>Is it &quot;gif&quot; or &quot;jif&quot;?</li>
<li>Vim or Emacs?</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be able to submit topics, and event attendees will be able to vote for the topics they would like to discuss. We will run the discussion for about an hour, and afterwards, anyone who wishes can join us nearby for a chat/drink.</p>
<p>The format works best when there is a diverse group of people and opinions in the room, so whether you consider yourself an absolute beginner or a seasoned pro, do come and join.</p>
<p>Put your thinking caps on and start thinking of some questions you would like to ask!</p>

Historically the methods used have been largely file based, with EDF needing to share the data internally between many different systems for many different needs.</p>
<p>De-regulation, a more competitive energy market, a rising cost to serve energy and changes to industry processes has meant EDF needs to find ways to drive it&#39;s cost to serve down and stay competitive.</p>
<p>Event Driven Architecture is increasingly becoming the tool that EDF is choosing to manage the complexity of these energy interactions and solve these problems.</p>
<p>Kevin Baldwyn is a lead engineer at EDF energy and in this talk he will explain how EDF is using EDA to manage the complexity of UK Energy Interactions and describe some of the architecture, patterns, lessons learned, and why you may want to start using EDA in your applications.</p>

Join us as we wind down for 2022’s final first-Thursday-of-the-month in festive December, and we reflect on another fabulous and varied year of Async meetups. This year join us in-person or follow along online.</p>
<p>As with previous years, this won’t be a test of how much JavaScript you know. It’s more like a traditional pub quiz that promises to be humbling at any stage of your career. Come one, come all for this earnest contest for the ultimate prize of trivial knowledge!</p>

It&#39;s the perfect opportunity to give a peek at your passion project, try out a lightning talk, or just share what&#39;s on your mind. You’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web.</p>

The catch - you have to write as little JavaScript as possible. Solve each challenge in the least number of characters to win the game. Imagine the kind of stuff you’d never want to see make it into a real codebase… that’s what we’re looking for!</p>
<p>We are making an effort to ensure that this episode of JavaScript Golf will be suitable for people of all skill levels, so even if you’re reasonably new to JavaScript you should still be able to tackle the challenges (and we’ll be on hand to help if you need it!). Even if you don’t get the fewest number of characters we hope that the majority of attendees will learn a little something about JavaScript from each other along the way. So, don’t forget to bring your laptop, tablet, phone, or whatever you feel comfortable writing code on (with a text editor installed).</p>
<p>As always we welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you&#39;ve got a few years under your belt, or you&#39;re just starting to look into development we&#39;d love to have you along.</p>
<p>You will be able to join us in-person at <a href="https://www.spacesworks.com/brighton/trafalgar-place/">Spaces</a>, or online (via Zoom).</p>

<p>As with our previous event you will be able to join us in-person, or online (via Zoom).</p>
<p>On Thursday the 4th of August our very own <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSidSmith">Jake &#39;Sid&#39; Smith</a> - long time Async attendee and now co-organizer - will be running a session on how to improve your coding proficiency by better utilizing the tools at your disposal.</p>
<p>For the first part of the session Jake will be covering some tools, settings, shortcuts, and editor extensions you might not know about, that can help improve your coding quality, speed, and how you work collaboratively. These will mostly center around VSCode, but many will be applicable to other popular editors. There&#39;ll also be some live demos and if there&#39;s time, briefly cover some other tools that you can use alongside your editor.</p>
<p>After this initial demo we&#39;ll open the floor for others to suggest ways in which we can improve how we code - shortcuts, extensions, other tools, etc, have a chat, and demo some of the suggestions. Hopefully by the end of the session everyone will have at least a few little things to take from this to make their development experience easier.</p>
<p>As always we welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you&#39;ve got a few years under your belt, or you&#39;re just starting to look into development we&#39;d love to have you along.</p>

<p>As with our previous event you will be able to join us in-person, or online (via Zoom).</p>
<p>On Thursday the 7th of July we will be joined by Simon Downes of The Student Room Group who will be giving us a talk on how to level-up as a developer. One of a small few who can take any hat within a development department, be it from a technical level, all the way up to strategic leadership, Simon will explain how to progress a career within development, how you reach the next level, what skills developers need, both technical and soft, and how you can obtain or develop those skills.</p>

After 2 years without human contact you will finally have the opportunity to come face-to-face with like-minded developers and enthusiasts! Can&#39;t make it in-person? Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll also be able to join us online.</p>
<p>We are very happy to announce that on the evening of Wednesday 8th June, we will be hosting an in-person hybrid version of our popular <strong>&quot;Ask the Brains&quot;</strong> event for the first time. This means that you will have the ability to join us in-person at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/pkoNTTRA27bh5GKD8">PLATF9RM</a> in Brighton, or to join us online!</p>
<p>Inspired by the monthly Brighton <a href="http://brightonalt.net/">ALT.NET meetup</a>, we will be asking/talking/rambling about everything web-related - 5-10 minutes per topic.</p>
<p>The aim is to create a friendly environment for everyone to ask their <em>&quot;that thing you&#39;ve never understood but always been too afraid to ask&quot;</em> type questions, plus any other topics you feel like talking about on the night. Topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m new to development. Where do I get started?</li>
<li>I still don&#39;t get it! What the hell does <code>this</code> mean in Javascript?</li>
<li><code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, or is there a case for both</li>
<li>Do we have to accept that JavaScript is now a compiled language</li>
<li>How do you maintain a work-life balance</li>
<li>Should I write unit tests, integration tests, or both?</li>
<li>What are the beneficial aspects of Agile/Scrum, and what do you find less useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be able to submit topics, and event attendees will be able to vote for the topics they would like to discuss. We will run the discussion for about an hour, and afterwards, anyone who wishes can join us nearby for a chat/drink (sorry we can&#39;t take you online folks with us).</p>
<p>The format works best when there is a diverse group of people and opinions in the room, so whether you consider yourself an absolute beginner or a seasoned pro, do come and join.</p>
<p>So, please put your thinking caps on now and start thinking of some questions you would like to ask.</p>
<p>We&#39;re all looking forward to seeing you!</p>
<p>Whether you&#39;re thinking of joining us in-person or online, please sign up to the event on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Async-Web-Tech-Meetup/events/286286575/">meetup.com</a>.

It builds on the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">“git scraping” approach pioneered by Simon Willison</a> to offer a simple pattern for bringing working datasets into your repositories and versioning them, because developing against local datasets is faster and easier than working with data over the wire.</p>
<p>The team at GitHub Next is focused on enabling new developer workflows. They&#39;ll walk through how their <a href="https://next.github.com/projects/flat-data/">Flat Data project</a> makes it easy to bring data from anywhere on the web directly into your own repos for processing, analyzing, and versioning.</p>
<hr>
<p>Talk starts at 7.45pm UK time, but the zoom will be open from 7.30pm so feel free to join early for a chinwag.</p>
