<p>In this session, <strong>Kyran Dale</strong> gives a practical introduction to <a href="http://requirejs.org">RequireJS</a>, an open-source library for creating <em>modular</em> JavaScript applications. With RequireJS, code can be organised into separate modules that can be loaded <em>asynchronously</em> in the browser, without polluting the global namespace.</p>

<p>Unlike more traditional programming languages, JavaScript has no built-in ability to import modules of code with protected namespaces. Scripts are strung together on the DOM in a global soup, and namespaces are usually described by the convention of having a single global object contain the functionality for a library or API. Naming collisions and messy code architecture can be the result.</p>

<p>As programmers start to craft large JavaScript libraries and applications, and as JavaScript development moves server-side with projects like <a href="http://asyncjs.com/nodejs/">Node.js</a>, the need for a way to structure code in a modular form becomes more pressing.</p>

<p>We'll take a look at how to use RequireJS, the questions it raises, some proposed alternatives and the motivation for having modular code shared by the client and server.</p>

<p>RequireJS is an open source project created by Mozilla and Dojo's <a href="http://tagneto.blogspot.com">James Burke</a> and can be <a href="http://github.com/jrburke/requirejs">forked on GitHub</a>. For more information, see <a href="http://requirejs.org">requirejs.org</a></p>
