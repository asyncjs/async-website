It’s 2031. Society, as we knew it in 2021, has officially collapsed. Broken hardware and a very slow internet connection are all we have left.

Accessibility on the web is now paramount to the survival of the human race. 

But how do you ensure your website is accessible amidst a raging apocalypse?

Join [whitep4nth3r](https://whitep4nth3r.com/) to explore why only the most accessible and inclusive websites will survive an apocalypse, how you can utilise free tools to ensure you are building for the apocalypse, and why all of this is more important than ever now, in 2021.
***

Talk starts at 7.45pm UK time, but the zoom will be open from 7.30pm so feel free to join early for a chinwag.
