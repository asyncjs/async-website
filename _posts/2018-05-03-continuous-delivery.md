I'm fascinated by how websites are built and released in to the world. I've been doing it in all sorts of ways for over fifteen years at companies like Microsoft, the Guardian, Twitter, and currently Brandwatch in Brighton. Over that time I've got somewhat opinionated about effective ways of releasing things on the web, whether that's web frontends, APIs, or cloud infrastructure.

I think there are some core methodologies to developing, testing, building, and deploying software that lead to rapid, high quality, low-risk releases. Methodologies that empower developers and designers to get their work in front of users quickly, leading to better products and a much more rewarding and reliable way of developing.

We'll talk through some of these methodologies and principles, and look at some specific implementations and examples.
