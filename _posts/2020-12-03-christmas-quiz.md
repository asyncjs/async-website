Welcome to the first ever Async Christmas Quiz! As we welcome web tech loving folk of all levels of experience, this will _not_ be a quiz about how much JavaScript you know - it's a community quiz more in line with a traditional pub quiz. So please come along, either as a team or by yourself, and let's send off this rotten year in style!
