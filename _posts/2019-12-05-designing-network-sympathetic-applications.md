Network specialist Chris Tomkins' talk will take you through some interesting and non-obvious characteristics of how TCP/IP networks like the Internet work, and how you can design your client-server applications to be "good citizens" and perform well in a variety of suboptimal networking scenarios.

The audience should have a basic understanding of IP addresses, and ideally a bit of knowledge about TCP/IP and building client/server/websockets applications.

### "Lightning" Talk

I'm happy to announce that Daniel van Berzon will be doing an extended lightning talk at the start of the evening to provide us with the findings from his groundbreaking [experiment on code readability](https://www.howreadable.com).

### Update!


This meetup now be sponsored by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/), so beers and pizzas for all! If you have any dietary requirements, please get in touch at hello AT asyncjs DOT com.
