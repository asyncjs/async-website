Join us the evening before [EVOLVE](https://evolve.siliconbrighton.com/) for the meetup social of all meetup socials. This is a Silicon Brighton community wide event - a chance for us all to get together the night before SB's flagship event EVOLVE - an extraordinary day of tech innovation & community.

This is a social for the entire Silicon Brighton community and not specific to any meetup - there will be people from similar meetups that you will get the chance to meet/have a chat with.

Entry to the social is free of charge but if you haven't bought your EVOLVE [25] ticket yet they are still available below:
