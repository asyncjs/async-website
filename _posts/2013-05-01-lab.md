After nearly three years of being held at the beautiful [Skiff co-working space][skiff], Async is shifting its venue.

We're not moving a million miles away. In fact, we'll be just a few metres over the road, at the new **[Lab for the Recently Possible][L4RP]** at 45 Gloucester Street, in Brighton's North Laine (see [map and directions][L4RP-location]).

The Lab is a space for workshops, hack days and projects at the edge of technology, art, culture and society.

Thank you so much to The Skiff for giving us a perfect space in which to grow and explore.

We'll see you [next][next] at the Lab...
