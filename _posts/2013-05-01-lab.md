Hi all,
After nearly three years of being held at the beautiful [Skiff][skiff] co-working space, Async is shifting not a million miles away (just a few metres over the road, to be precise) to the new [Lab for the Recently Possible][L4RP] at 45 Gloucester Street, in Brighton's North Laine ([map & directions][L4RP-location]).

The Lab is a space for workshops, hack days and projects at the edge of technology, art, culture and society.

Thank you so much to The Skiff for giving us a perfect space in which to grow and explore.

We'll see you next at the Lab...
