You: a web developer, building an app for mobile. You're using React Native, I'm guessing. In search of speed, you've looked for React Native plugins on npmjs and found specialized packages written in a variety of Java, Objective-C and C++.

James will talk about a new option: Rust, and specifically, [`uniffi-rs`](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs): a tool for running portable Rust from iOS, Android, Python and now: React Native.

He will talk about what it is, how it works, and what he's learned about Javascript while building the bindings generator for React Native.

At Mozilla, [James](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugman/) worked on the core `uniffi-rs` team. Now, he is building uniffi backends enabling more languages to talk to Rust. He is currently working with a stealth startup to generate Matrix SDK plugins for React Native, Electron and nodejs.

We welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along.

You will be able to join us in-person at [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship) or online (link added closer to the time).
