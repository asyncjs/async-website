This session will explain how to get a mobile web app into the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/">iPhone app store</a> using <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a> - an open source development framework for building cross-platform mobile apps, for iPhone, iPad, Google Android, Palm, Symbian and Blackberry.

<a href="http://mark-kirby.co.uk">Mark Kirby</a> will demonstrate how easy it is to get started. He'll look at other platforms, such as Android, take us through the native APIs and touch on a few libraries that you might find useful. He'll pass on advice from his own experiences, along with some insider tips on how to get your apps to appear as native as possible.

Mark is the lead developer at mobile design company, <a href="http://ribot.co.uk">Ribot</a>, and an occasional writer for <a href="http://www.netmag.co.uk">.net magazine</a>. He's recently been working on the <a href="http://ribot.co.uk/2010/ribot-launch-tesco-iphone-grocery-app/">Tesco Grocery widget for Nokia</a>, which allows people to shop online from their phones. You can find him blogging on the pros and cons of mobile platforms over at <a href="http://mark-kirby.co.uk">mark-kirby.co.uk</a>
