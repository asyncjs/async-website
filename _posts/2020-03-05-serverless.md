With serverless backends, front-end developers can build confidently in the cloud from prototype to production without managing infrastructure.
 
In this session you will learn about tooling, frameworks, and architectural patterns focused on building a web application from front to back. Along the way we will discuss best practices to help you get a started on developing without needing to manage servers. I will demo the solutions, and show how you can integrate these common web app features with minimal code.

If you are a front-end developer wondering how serverless can help you, this session is for you!
