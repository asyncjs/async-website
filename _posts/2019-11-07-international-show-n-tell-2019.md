The November migration of the world's top web developers to the sunny city of Brighton &amp; Hove can only mean one thing - [FFConf 2019][ff] is coming. So, it's time for another **International Async Show'n'tell**! This year's instalment will be _on Thursday 7th November_. The ever popular International show'n'tell is the perfect opportunity to give a peek at your passion project, try out a lightning talk, or just share what's on your mind.

_If you’d like to grab a speaking slot_, you’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web. We hope to bring together a blend of local projects with those from travellers to England for the conference.

Speakers, please <a data-gist href="https://gist.github.com/orangespaceman/196f4e37b2dcd5bee37fe1367bbf2896">add a comment to the Speakers' Gist</a>.
