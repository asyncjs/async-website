Async has primarily been a JavaScript meetup since it was founded (back in 2010!). We can all learn a lot from looking at other languages though, and one of the more elegant web languages around is [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Luckily, our own [Dot Wingrove](https://twitter.com/notthepoint) is a Rubyist and will be our guide. 

This talk will teach you a bit about Ruby via the medium of rock-paper-scissors, plus a little bit about AI history. It will also make you laugh â€” at least a little. You'll also learn some game theory, some mind games, and finally, how to build a world champion bot in the universe of Rock Paper Scissors.

The talk is aimed at all developers even if they're new to Ruby, but anyone with some Ruby background should also find it interesting. All the examples in the talk and are explained step by step, and many of them relatively basic.
