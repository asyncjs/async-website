Async has primarily been a JavaScript meetup since it was founded (back in 2010!). We can all learn a lot from looking at other languages though, and one of the more elegant web languages around is [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Luckily, our own [Dot Wingrove](https://twitter.com/notthepoint) is a Rubyist and will be our guide, showing us how to make a Rock/Paper/Scissors bot in the language. Further details TBC.
