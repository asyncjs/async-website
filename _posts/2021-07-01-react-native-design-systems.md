David Leuliette will be taking us from zero to hero with React Native thanks to the power of design systems. No prior knowledge of React or React Native will be required.

From David:

"With React Native, you style your application using JavaScript. The more you add developers and features, the more design consistency problems and pain points will appear.

Let's explore together how to create a first-class developer experience when managing styles and themes with restyle and storybook!"

Talk starts at 7.45pm UK time, but the zoom will be open from 7.30pm so feel free to join early for a chinwag.
