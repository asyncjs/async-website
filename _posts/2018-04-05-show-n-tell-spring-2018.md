It's 2018 and after a few great talks, and our new [Ask The Brains][ask-the-brains] evening of tech discussion, we're back with another Show n' Tell! Last year we had a great range of projects and topics ranging from creative CSS animations and generating "marble flow" textures in real time, to taking a look at some emerging languages and proposals for unit testing tools. And, not to forget, we had our youngest ever speaker, at only 8 years old, showing off a javascript game they had made.

Come along and see what awesome stuff the community has been working on, share your own projects, or talk about something you're passionate about. We'd love to see you there.

_If you’d like to grab a speaking slot_, you’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, or the wider world of tech.

Speakers, please <a data-gist href="https://gist.github.com/JakeSidSmith/45e60f8c45ab5128d760d33de7c3e3e1">add a comment to the Speakers' Gist</a>.
