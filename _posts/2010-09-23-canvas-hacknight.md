<a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6976972">Add yourself to the event on Upcoming</a>

You've <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/canvas.html">read the book</a>. You've <a href="http://asyncjs.com/canvas/">watched the talk</a>. You've <a href="http://www.canvasdemos.com">seen the demos</a>. You've laughed! You've cried! Now come along to the <strong>Canvas Hack Night</strong>.

No experience necessary <em>(you don't have to have read the book, or seen the talk)</em>. It's a perfect opportunity to begin experimenting with drawing on the HTML5 canvas element, or to catch up with others, to work on your visual masterpiece.

There's no set agenda. Just a friendly atmosphere for an evening of JavaScript hackery.

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> We have prizes to give away! Copies of "<a href="http://introducinghtml5.com">Introducing HTML5</a>" by <a href="http://remysharp.com">Remy Sharp</a> and <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk">Bruce Lawson</a>. Game on.
