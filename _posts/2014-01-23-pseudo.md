If you've been keeping tabs on various blogs recently, you'll probably have noticed there's a lot of talk surrounding a new breed of UI designers. We've seen responsive design kill Photoshop and as a result designers have become code literate and turned to browsers as their primary design tool.

The problem this presents is that code isn't always the most flexible design environment, and our markup can quickly become messy while we're cycling through ideas. Pseudo elements are a tiny corner of CSS that give us big wins by opening up interesting design possibilities and improving the semantics of our markup.

In this talk, [Mat Griffiths](https://twitter.com/Mat_Methodik) will be exploring what pseudo elements are, what they aren't, their theoritical implications and as many practical use cases as possible to give attendees knowledge they can use straight away.
