[AngularJS][angular] has exploded in popularity, but the lack of guidance on the right way to use [Angular][angular] from the authors has resulted in teams with collapsing productivity. Gigantic controllers that everyone's too afraid to touch, scopes knotting the whole app together, persistence concerns leaking throughout, a sadly empty test folder... Applying some evergreen UI patterns, and a smattering of [Angular][angular] specific tools, can make it all so much simpler.

In this session founder of [SidekickJS][sidekick] and Javascript guru Tim Ruffles teaches us how to write AngularJS the right way!

#About the speaker

[Tim][tim] has been building, teaching and speaking on Javascript web-applications for years, using a range of frameworks. He is currently building [SidekickJS][sidekick], a code-quality tool for teams, and contracting with [Capco][capco] on a data-visualisation tool using D3, [Angular][angular] and NodeJS.

#Update: Pizza!
