We do not yet have a confirmed speaker for this date. Watch this space. [Join the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/asyncjs/) if you'd like to be notified, or [follow @asyncjs on Twitter](https://twitter.com/asyncjs).

If you think you might like to give a session, either this time or in future, then please get in touch at [&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#121;&#110;&#99;&#106;&#115;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;](&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#121;&#110;&#99;&#106;&#115;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;). This is a community event, and anyone who has something to share is welcome.

Async is about JavaScript, its environment and its relatives on the front-as well as the back-end. We cover technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, Node.js, Git, as well as architecture, design, animation, development workflow, tools, philosophy and business.

Sessions often take the form of a talk led by a speaker, but there are no particular rules. We've hosted hack nights, show n' tells, soap boxes, experiments, launches and demos.
