This is a community event, and anyone who has something to share is welcome.

Async is about JavaScript, its environment and its relatives on the front-as well as the back-end. We cover technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, Node.js, Git, as well as architecture, design, animation, development workflow, tools, philosophy and business.

Sessions often take the form of a talk led by a speaker, but there are no particular rules. We've hosted hack nights, show n' tells, soap boxes, experiments, launches and demos.
