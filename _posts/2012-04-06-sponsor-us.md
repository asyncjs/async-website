Async is now completing its second year of twice monthly JavaScript events,
and we want to build on our successes. We are looking for companies or
individuals who would like to sponsor Async each month, allowing us to invest
in our community.

### What is the sponsorship for?

We would like to be able to pay someone in the community to assist with event
promotion and management, to record, edit and publish a podcast of audio/video
recordings for the wider web, and more besides (let us know if you could be
that person, or have some other ideas).

We would like to be able to cover travel and accommodation for our out-of-town
speakers, and a pre-Async meal.

We would like to purchase equipment, such as a camcorder, tripod, projector,
microphone, cables and more.

### Why sponsor?

By sponsoring Async, you support our grassroots efforts and develop a closer
relationship with our community â€“ just as the Guardian did when they sponsored
our early months.

If you are potentially interested, we can send you details of our sponsorship
packages and tell you about all the benefits. Please email us at

Thanks. We look forward to partnering with you.
