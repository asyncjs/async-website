Reponsive design is hot. JavaScript is cool. But mix them together in the wrong
quantities and you can end up with a bit of a tepid mess. Don't settle for
luke-warm! Instead come along and find out how a spot of carefully considered
JavaScript can help rather than hinder the users of your beautiful
device-independent website.

We'll be covering:

- What JavaScript can bring to the responsive web design table.
- Potential pitfalls, considerations and suggested best practices
- Useful tools and libraries.
- Real-world examples of sites doing it right (and maybe a few that are doing
  it wrong!).
