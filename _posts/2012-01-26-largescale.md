<p>Developers creating JavaScript applications these days usually use a combination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC</a>, modules, widgets and plugins for their architecture. They also use a DOM manipulation library like jQuery.</p>

<p>Whilst this works great for apps that are built at a smaller-scale, what happens when your project really starts to grow? In this talk, <a href="http://addyosmani.com">Addy Osmani</a> presents an effective set of <span class="summary">design patterns for medium to large-scale JavaScript application architecture</span> that have previously been used at both AOL and Yahoo, amongst others.</p>

<p>You'll learn how to keep your application logic truly decoupled, build modules that can exist on their own or be dropped into other projects, and future-proof your code in case you need to switch to a different DOM library in the future.</p>

<p>This session is aimed at intermediate-advanced JavaScript developers, but is designed such that beginners should be able to get a takeaway from it, without being too overwhelmed.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani">Addy Osmani</a> is a JavaScript developer for AOL who prolifically writes about JavaScript on a weekly basis. His material covers everything from building large-scale applications to using polyfills to bring the web's latest hotness to older browsers.</p>

<p>Whilst Addy loves writing, his true passion is in helping move the web (even a little) forward. He's a member of the jQuery Core bug triage and docs teams and has also contributed to open-source projects such as <a href="http://www.modernizr.com">Modernizr</a>.</p>

<p>Addy is currently writing his second open-source book, '<a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/backbone-fundamentals/">Backbone Fundamentals</a>', about <a href="http://asyncjs.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a>, which can be <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals">downloaded from GitHub</a> along with his some of his other open source projects.</p>
