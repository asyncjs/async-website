<p class="summary">JavaScript is a richly diverse language with a million and one approaches to solving a problem. Its flexibility can be both a blessing and a curse, but through the myriad of choices, interesting coding patterns start to emerge.</p>

<p>In this session, <a href="http://jimpurbrick.com">Jim Purbrick</a> shares his own journey of discovery in JavaScript and explains the architectural patterns that he's found useful. You are invited to share your own patterns and revelations, and we'll compare the merits and use cases of each.</p>

<p>We'll cover private methods, closures, namespaces, modules, inheritance, overloading and more.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/JimPurbrick">Jim</a> arrived at JavaScript from over a decade working with object-oriented static languages, including several years at the helm of <a href="http://lindenlab.com">Linden Lab</a>'s European headquarters in Brighton, creating technical infrastructure for the virtual world, <a href="http://secondlife.com">Second Life</a>.</p>

<h2>Update: Video and slides online</h2>
<p>Jim has posted <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JimPurbrick/engineering-javascript">slides</a> and <a href="http://jimpurbrick.com/2011/03/12/21st-century-javascript/">video</a> from the session.</p>
