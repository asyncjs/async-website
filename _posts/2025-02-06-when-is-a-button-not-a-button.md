On the Thursday Feb 6th we'll be joined by Helen Brockelbank - accessibility specialist, front end developer, and bird enthusiast.

Have you ever tried using a web interface only to find interactive elements broken or content missing? This is a daily struggle for assistive technology users, and it can leave them excluded from our increasingly digital world.

In this talk we‚Äôll look at how accessibility APIs interact with the DOM so we can all make websites that are more useful than a sewing machine made of cake.

You will be able to join us in-person at [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship) or online via YouTube (link added closer to the event).

We welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along.

üçï Pizza and üçª drinks will be provided thanks to sponsorship from [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship) and [Silicon Brighton](https://siliconbrighton.com/).
