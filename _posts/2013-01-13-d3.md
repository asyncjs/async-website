[D3.js][d3.js] is a JavaScript library for data visualisation and interaction in the browser. Be it [bar charts][barcharts], [pie charts][piecharts], [chord diagrams][chorddiagrams], [tree diagrams][treediagrams] or even [force-directed graphs][forcedirected], D3 is your friend. D3 is an ideal platform for data interaction, due to its use of standard DOM elements, and can be used for both HTML and SVG.

In this talk, [Peter Cook][peter] will introduce D3 by showing some data visualisation examples, giving an overview of the library's components and walking through some simple code examples.

Peter is a freelance software developer based in Lewes, East Sussex and is fascinated by the possibilities now offered by modern browsers for data visualisation, interaction and exploration. He recently created an [interactive visualisation][energy] of his home energy consumption with D3.
