[nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io) is a free, community driven, open source educational project that teaches JavaScript and node.js skills in an interactive, self-guided way.

In collaboration with Async we're putting one on in Brighton â€“ come along to learn JavaScript or Node at your own pace, with guidance from our mentors, for free!

Register and attend if you want to meet up at 68 Middle St, Brighton ([@68MiddleSt](http://twitter.com/68MiddleSt)) and dive into a nodeschool workshop. There are workshops available for every skill level -- from JS beginners all the way to experienced node programmers.
