**NEW VENUE:** We're trialling a move to [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship), a brand new space we think makes an even better long-term home for Async meetups. Located a short walk from Brighton railway station on the ground floor of the new York & Elder development.

This month we bring you a special organisers' two-fer presented by Jake and Yann!

#### The Power of TypeScript

Jake will speak on advanced patterns in TypeScript you'll be glad to know. Along with powerful uses you may wish you didn't see. `<T>`rigger warning.

#### Picking up Tailwind

Yann will share a lightning talk on upcoming features in Tailwind that simplify the developer experience and progressively enhance new CSS concepts. Try to `@container` your excitement.

This session will explore advanced concepts and assumes a working knowledge of either or both tools. All experience levels are welcome as always, but this will be a chance to nerd out if your `:nth-of-type()` is type safe recursion for breakfast.
