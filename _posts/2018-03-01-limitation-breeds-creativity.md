In web dev, sometimes the sheer volume of things to learn can be overwhelming. Pair this with anxiety and a tendency to procrastinate and you’ve got the perfect recipe for doing absolutely nothing.

More choice doesn’t mean more creativity. When you work within constraints your mind has to look for unconventional ways around it. Come along to see me demo a few of my favourite unconventional solutions. (Some restrictions were even self inflicted.) 

Expect LOTS of CSS, and a bunch of (hopefully) clever hacks.

## Update

This meeting will be sponsored by [Rakuten](https://rakutenmarketing.com/en-uk/career/full-stack-engineer), who will provide pizzas and beers for all. Please get in touch if you have any specific dietary requirements at hello AT asyncjs DOT com.
