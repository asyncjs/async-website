<p>For this Async session, we are glad to present a talk from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/daniel-neame/8/a50/7b8">Dan Neame</a>, a JavaScript engineer at Brighton-based startup <a href="http://www.brandwatch.com">Brandwatch</a>, on <span class="summary">working with <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">Underscore.js</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a></span>.</p>
 
<p>Underscore.js is a 'utility-belt library' and it makes it a breeze to solve many of the common problems you'll see when working with jQuery.</p>

<p>Dan will have some interactive examples to show how jQuery and Underscore can work together to save time and headaches. Wading through an AJAX response? There's a function for that... Laggy scroll listeners? There's a function for that too!</p>
