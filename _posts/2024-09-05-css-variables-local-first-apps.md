On Thursday 5th September we will be joined by [James Chetwood](https://x.com/jchetters/) - Freelance Web Developer, and Dave Pereira-Gurnell - Developer/Trainer at [Spacecat](https://spacecat.io/) for a couple of exciting talks:

**Design GUI: Exploring CSS Variables.**

James will talk about talk about his project - Design GUI. Covering his process of starting with a vague idea and iterating through different technologies, eventually landing on a Chrome Extension and CSS Variables.

**Sync Different: Building Local-First Apps**

Does your web app work offline? What about supporting multiplayer editing? No? You’re not alone—these features are notoriously challenging to implement. Web development is already complex, and adding offline functionality or real-time collaboration is a step beyond what most of us are willing to try. Yet, a new wave of web and mobile apps, like Linear, Figma, and Goodnotes, are managing to deliver these capabilities seamlessly. In this talk, we’ll explore how apps like these are built and how you can leverage similar strategies in your own projects. Dave will back this up by walking you through a simple multiplayer editor using the open-source CRDT Automerge.

We welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along.

You will be able to join us in-person at [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship) or online (link will be added closer to the time).
