**Update**: unfortunately James Chetwood is now unable to give his talk - Design GUI: Exploring CSS Variables. Instead we will be continuing with only Dave Pereira-Gurnell's talk - Sync Different: Building Local-First Apps.

On Thursday 5th September we will be joined by Dave Pereira-Gurnell - Developer/Trainer at [Spacecat](https://spacecat.io/).

Does your web app work offline? What about supporting multiplayer editing? No? You’re not alone—these features are notoriously challenging to implement. Web development is already complex, and adding offline functionality or real-time collaboration is a step beyond what most of us are willing to try.

Yet, a new wave of web and mobile apps, like Linear, Figma, and Goodnotes, are managing to deliver these capabilities seamlessly. In this talk, we’ll explore how apps like these are built and how you can leverage similar strategies in your own projects.

We’re on the brink of a software development renaissance where building **local-first apps**—software that works offline but seamlessly syncs with the cloud—will become the norm. Dave will introduce you to powerful tools like **Operational Transforms** and **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types** (CRDTs) that make local-first development feasible, and show how they’re being packaged up into approachable open source tools. He'll back this up by walking you through a simple multiplayer editor using the open-source CRDT **Automerge**.

We welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along.

You will be able to join us in-person at [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship) or online (link will be added closer to the time).
