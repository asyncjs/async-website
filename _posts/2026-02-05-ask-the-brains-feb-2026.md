🍕🍻 **This event is not sponsored.**

After a couple of months off for the holidays, we're back with our popular **"Ask the Brains"** event. The aim is to create a friendly environment for everyone to ask their _"that thing you've never understood but always been too afraid to ask"_ type questions, plus any other topics you feel like talking about on the night.

We will be asking/talking/rambling about everything web-related - 5-10 minutes per topic, such as:

- Tabs or spaces for indentation?
- Is it okay to use "!important" in CSS?
- Is it better to have a light or dark theme for your IDE?
- Should you write comments in your code, or is it better to write self-documenting code?
- Should you use "camelCase" or "snake_case" for variable names in your code?
- Is it better to use single or double quotes in JavaScript?
- Is it "gif" or "jif"?
- Vim or Emacs?

You will be able to submit topics with event attendees voting for the topics they would like to discuss. We will run the discussion for about an hour after which you have the option to retire to a local brewery to discuss the night away.

The format works best when there is a diverse group of people and opinions in the room, so whether you consider yourself an absolute beginner or a seasoned pro, do come and join.

Put your thinking caps on and start thinking of some questions you would like to ask!
