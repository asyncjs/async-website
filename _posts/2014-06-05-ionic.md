[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) is a framework for building native-quality hybrid apps with HTML5 and AngularJS. Using Ionic, anyone with some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can go from nothing to something amazing quicker than ever before.

In this talk, Ryan Hanna will discuss why Ionic has the incredible potential to change the way we feel about hybrid app development with PhoneGap and other similar technologies.

This talk is for anyone who wants to have a go at their first mobile project, hack away at a prototype for the weekend, or develop a production level app for distribution on iOS and Android.

Ionic provides professionally designed components and UI interaction for your app while using PhoneGap to interact with native features. Ionicâ€™s deep integration with AngularJS provides the UI interactions, gestures, routing, and other useful directives that save you from having to reinvent these for every project.

Even if you have not used AngularJS in the past, the simple layout of Ionic's seed projects will allow you to ease your way into learning the concepts of AngularJS with just a few manipulations of their examples.
