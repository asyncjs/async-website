Getting productive with Claude Code — an agent that's brilliant, opinionated, and occasionally makes things up.

In this talk Dave will get into the reality of agentic AI development — what it's genuinely good at (in his opinion), where it'll burn you, and how to tune it to your philosophies.

He'll cover live demos across:

- Solving a Project Euler using Claude
- Adding features to an existing open source codebase
- Building something complex from scratch with parts you don't know

We'll also look at why running your own infrastructure matters more, not less, in an agentic world — and why "just deploy to Vercel" might be the wrong move.

You'll leave with a mental model of where Claude Code (is it really a lazy, immoral, subversive, gaslighting liar?) may fit more into your workflow, and enough live demos to either excite or terrify you. Probably both.
