<p>Perhaps you've been using jQuery for a while now but have yet to write or even appreciate the need to write a plugin. This session sets out to introduce you to <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring"><span class="summary">jQuery plugin development</span></a>, why you might want to consider it, how to get started and what the benefits are.</p>

<p><a href="http://nubz.com">Alistair Macdonald</a> will lead the session, dealing with questions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>What does it mean to have a plugin?</li>
	<li>What's so good about jQuery plugins?</li>
	<li>What are some practical examples?</li>
	<li>How do I create a plugin? (Live coding!)</li>
	<li>What do I need to bear in mind when I create one?</li>
	<li>Great! So, I made a plugin. Should I share it with others? How should I do that?</li>
	<li>When shouldn't I create a jQuery plugin and simply create a useful script that has a jQuery dependency?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nubz">Ali</a> is a local freelance JavaScript and PHP developer, and a coordinator at <a href="https://asyncjs.com">Async</a>.</p>
