Have you ever wanted to write your own language?

Have you ever written code to cut up strings, and hated yourself for how ugly and brittle it is?

This talk will give you [superpowers](https://xkcd.com/208/).

This talk will cover a fair amount of ground, not usually associated with Javascript, but should be both educational and entertaining.

James has written several parsers and compilers professionally, and was surprised and delighted to find [PEG.js](http://pegjs.majda.cz/), a tool that makes it not just possible, but fun, and in Javascript. He'd like to impart some of its magic to you.

There will be slides and code, and slides with code, though it is aimed at the beginner to intermediate developer.
