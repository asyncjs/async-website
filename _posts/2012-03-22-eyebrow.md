__Single-page apps are the new black__ But how do you build a website that can
do server-side rendering while also being a single-page app on the client-side?

__EyebrowJS__ is the template and UI system used at [State][#state], a
London-based startup building a __global opinion network__. It's used for
server-side rendering from a Node.js server and client-side magic, including
managing UI, animations, page transitions and reactive data-binding. We'll
discuss how Eyebrow is architected and what it means for web application
development.

__Mark Wubben__ is a web hacker at State, hailing from the Continent. You may want
to follow him on Twitter as [@novemberborn][#twitter] or his never-updating
blog at [novemberborn.net][#site].
