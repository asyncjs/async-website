**NOTE THE NEW VENUE:** [Lab for the Recently Possible](http://L4RP.com), opposite The Skiff.


It turns out that we can't have it all when we are dealing with the kind of distributed systems required by today's web-scale applications. 

Brewer's Theorem tells us that for any such system we cannot simultaneously guarantee *Consistency*, *Availability* and tolerance to *Partitioning*. We can fulfill any two but we are stuck with a weaker version of whatever is left.

So what happens then when we choose to relax the requirement of data consistency? And how are we going to write reliable code in these situations?

In this talk, [Cristiano Solarino][cristiano] will look at one approach to cope with this scenario called *Convergent Replicated Data Types* using [Riak][riak] as the reference example of an *eventually consistent* database. Cris will explain why he thinks *CRDT*s are really cool (*warning:* may contains some maths!) and will walk through a couple of simple examples in [Node][node].

We'll then look at adding a constraint on the type of operations we can perform on our *CRDT*s, by creating a generic [Node][node] module to make our dev life a bit easier.

Cristiano is one-third of [BrightMinded][brightminded]'s dev team. Feed him Tiramisu and you'll have gained a friend for life.
