### Update - Slides

The slides for Matt's talk can be found here: [http://slides.com/gauntface/everything-is-awesome](http://slides.com/gauntface/everything-is-awesome#/)

***

As a native app developer, working in a web developer's world, the perspective is always going to be warped in comparison to a seasoned web pro.

This talk covers the trials, tribulations, victories, and pillar stones Matt Gaunt holds dear to his heart when working with the web; covering topics ranging from the highs and lows of pure native development, to the hybrid approaches, and of course the pure web.

In the wise words of the Lego song - "Everything is Awesome".

Bio:

Matt is an ex-Brighton resident who now works at Google as a Chrome Developer Advocate. He is an experienced developer, though specialized in native mobile development, has a hand in all the pies of hybrid development. His ambition, since being a young boy, is to be able to grow a beard.
