<p class="summary">In this session, <a class="url fn" href="http://twitter.com/adactio">Jeremy Keith</a> will talk about <strong>designing for the web</strong>, examining what makes the web its own medium and how it differs from print, for example.</p>

<p>We'll cast an eye over the tools and processes that we currently use for designing websites and demonstrate where they are problematic. Then we'll turn to the tools of our trade: HTML, CSS and JavaScript and focus specifically on the presentation layer: CSS.</p>

<p>With the addition of CSS <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">media queries</a> to our arsenal of tools, it's finally becoming possible to design experiences that are truly <em>native to the web</em> rather than creating pages that are optimised only for a specific screen size.</p>

<p>Jeremy is a <span class="role">web developer</span> at <a class="org url" href="http://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a>. He's written a few books, most recently <a href="http://books.alistapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers">HTML5 For Web Designers</a>. He <span class="role">plays bouzouki</span> in the band <a class="url org" href="http://saltercane.com">Salter Cane</a> and writes on his website, <a class="url" href="http://adactio.com">adactio.com</a>.</p>
