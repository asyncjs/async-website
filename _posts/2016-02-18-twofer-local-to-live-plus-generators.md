In this special two for one evening, we'll be welcoming Graham Smith to the Async stage for the first time, with a talk entitled "From Local To Live":

> Local development environments and deploying to live servers can be tricky and also subjective. At Clearleft, over the course of a year, we moved to using Virtual Machines for local development and unmanaged servers for our hosting. We then wrote a command-line tool focused on simplifying local development and managing our remote servers. We called it ‘Elf’.

> In this talk I’d like to share our setup, the system we built and some of the things we’ve learnt along the way.

Graham will be joined by Yann Eves with an as yet unnamed talk.

Further details TBC.
