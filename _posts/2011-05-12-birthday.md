<p><strong>Happy Birthday to us! Happy Birthday to us!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yes, Async is now one year old</strong> - and what a year it's been. Ever since Simon Willison's inspirational <a href="http://asyncjs.com/nodejs/">first session on server-side JavaScript</a>, we've kept up the pace with twice monthly talks on some of the hottest topics in modern web development. A brand new community of developers has been born.</p>

<p class="summary">Today, we celebrate our birthday with the ever-popular <em>Show n' Tell</em>. Come and show us what you've been up to in the land of JavaScript (/HTML5/CSS3...): interesting little projects, clever uses of a technique, or insightful websites and apps you've stumbled across that have changed your thinking on the ways of the web.</p>

<p>Sessions are 5 minutes + 5 minutes for questions. You can see our previous Show n' Tells <a href="http://asyncjs.com/showntell/">here</a>, <a href="http://asyncjs.com/showntell2/">here</a> and <a href="http://asyncjs.com/showntell3/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Please let us know in <a href="http://asyncjs.com/birthday/#comments">the comments on this blog post</a></strong> if (and what) you'd like to share with us. Don't be shy... all are very welcome.</p>
