Amanda is a Google Developers Expert for Firebase, and a Developer Advocate at [Vonage](https://twitter.com/vonagedev), which provides cloud communications APIs for Messaging (SMS, MMS, social chats apps such as Messenger and WhatsApp), Verify, Voice, and Video, Network APIs, as well as associated tooling and language-specific SDKs.

In this talk, Amanda will demonstrate using Firebase Cloud Functions to handle backend logic, Firestore to store user data and verification requests, Firebase Emulators to test, and Firebase Hosting to serve the web application.

She will use the Vonage APIs for SIM swap detection and verification through SMS. The demo application includes a simple bank dashboard and a login form. If the SIM Swap API detects that a phone number was swapped recently, the verification code will not be sent, and additional security measures will be applied. A verification code will be sent via the Verify v2 API to authenticate the user if no recent swap is detected.

We welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along.

You will be able to join us in-person at [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship) or [online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFu7AExOMOs).
