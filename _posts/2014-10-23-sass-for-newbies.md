[Sass](sass) (or Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) has established itself as one of the most comprehensive CSS extension languages around.

This talk is aimed at people who have heard of Sass but are yet to delve into it.

How does it work? How does it compare to plain CSS?

I will be covering all the basics. Partials, nesting, variables, mixins and extends. We'll then move onto operations, functions and directives.

Learn some best practises when writing Sass, and how to avoid some of the common pitfalls.
