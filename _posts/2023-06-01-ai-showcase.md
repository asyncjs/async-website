The Async community has been busy prompting so it's time we give that creativity a stage. An AI Show n' Tell.. a Prompt n' Tell!

We'll have a line up of lightning talks and demos along with some rigs set up to get hands-on with some different AI tech.

Open to all levels of experience and not limited to the web. While we can get excited by the flashy new possibilities of large language and diffusion models, the debate is rapidly evolving around how to regulate and venture safely towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and perhaps Superintelligence.

Drop a comment on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/async-web-tech-meetup/events/293744253/), message in the [Async Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/asyncjs/shared_invite/zt-1aguxx86q-XjF_yWcFoJ8fyYYzoqgDaQ) or email [hello@asyncjs.com](mailto:hello@asyncjs.com) if you'd like to share your own lightning talk or demo.
