In this talk I'll show what async-await is, how it helps, and ways you can start using it now. If I have time, I'll demo a small express/koa inspired experiment which can consume async functions as middleware.

This talk is aimed at intermediate and above JS programmers, although I'll try to start simple with a quick explanation of Promises and Generators (which are the foundation of async-await).

Mark is a JavaScript developer at local company Brandwatch.
