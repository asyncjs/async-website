<p>For the last ten years, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a> developers have been creating rich media apps and games with immersive visuals. Now that the open standards <a href="http://asyncjs.com/canvas/">Canvas</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/SVG">SVG</a> are available natively in all major browsers, we JavaScript developers have much to learn from the techniques that Flash devs have put to use this past decade.</p>

<p class="summary">From particle systems to blending effects, optimised animations and good old maths creativity, <span class="vcard"><a href="http://twitter.com/seb_ly" class="fn url">Seb Lee-Delisle</a></span> has more than a trick or two to share with us. If you're interested in bringing a little visceral beauty to your websites, apps and games, then this is the session for you.</p>

<p>Seb is one of the founders of Brighton-based <a href="http://www.pluginmedia.net">Plug-in Media</a>, who've won two Baftas and other awards for their innovative Flash creations. Recently, he's been <a href="http://sebleedelisle.com/2010/11/creative-javascripthtml5-training/">training JavaScript developers</a> in creative animation and 3D Canvas techniques.</p>
