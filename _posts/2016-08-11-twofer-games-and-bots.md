Time for another double bill (hence the picture, geddit?) you lucky things! We will see Graham Smith return to the stage to give us an update on his epic adventure to build a game in JavaScript. Carl Bateman will then tell us how WebGL re-introduced him to JavaScript. Two tenuously intertwined talks -- being a lightning tour of some of the possibilities of WebGL and a peek into some of the darker corners of JavaScript.
