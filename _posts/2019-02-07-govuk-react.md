govuk-react is a React component library for building govuk-styled web applications. We will be giving a demo of its usage, an overview of the technologies used to develop it and show our continuous integration setup including visual regression tests and preview environments.

This will be useful for anyone interested in:

- automated tests and CI pipelines for UI focussed code
- building UI component libraries or design systems
- React

Alasdair McLeay and Steve Sims are freelance UI developers, currently working on a large public sector project for IBM.
