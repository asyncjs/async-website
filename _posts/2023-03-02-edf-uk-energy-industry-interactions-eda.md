The UK energy industry is made up of lots of parties that need to communicate information with each other. Historically the methods used have been largely file based, with EDF needing to share the data internally between many different systems for many different needs. 

De-regulation, a more competitive energy market, a rising cost to serve energy and changes to industry processes has meant EDF needs to find ways to drive it's cost to serve down and stay competitive.

Event Driven Architecture is incresaingly becoming the tool that EDF is choosing to manage the complexity of these energy interactions and enable it to meet it's compliance obligations,
