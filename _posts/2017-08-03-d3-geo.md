For thousands of years humans have sought to understand the physical world through the making of maps, and that is as true today as it was all those millennia ago. Countless tools now exist to help with making maps and the JavaScript world is no exception, with several libraries that make it easier than ever to create and experiment with maps. One of those libraries is D3, which contains some powerful features for making beautiful interactive maps.

In this talk Peter Cook will show us the process of making maps using D3, starting with acquiring geographic data, converting it to GeoJSON, and rendering it using D3. Along the way he'll cover issues such as SVG vs. Canvas rendering, projections, choropleth maps and how to make a spinning globe with a few lines of JavaScript (and D3). Whether you're a JavaScript coder, or just someone who's interested in the current techniques for making maps, this is a talk no to be missed!

[Peter Cook](http://animateddata.co.uk/) is a freelance data visualisation designer and developer. He's the author of [D3 in Depth](http://d3indepth.com/) and also runs the [Data Visualisation Brighton Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Visualisation-Brighton/).
