Static type systems are all the rage these days.
Languages like Typescript, Elm, and Purescript,
use static types to reason about code without running it,
eliminating certain classes of bugs and making code easier to understand.

However, adopting a new programming language comes at a cost.
Wouldn't it be nice if we could benefit from static types
in our existing Javascript code
without jumping over to a new language?

Enter Facebook's [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow),
a static type checker for ordinary Javascript.
In this talk I'll show you how to add Flow
to an existing Javascript project.
I'll demonstrate how Flow's static types work and how
they'll help uncover bugs in your code.
Finally, I'll talk about how to adjust your programming style
to get the most benefit from static types.
