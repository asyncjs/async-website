D3 has established itself as the JavaScript library of choice for producing data visualisations and its flexible architecture enables the visualisation of a wide array of data types including lists, trees and networks.

In this talk Peter Cook will focus on the concept of layouts in D3. In essence a layout is a function that transforms your data into a form that can then be easily rendered in the browser. 

Layouts share a common usage pattern and understanding how they work will not only make more advanced visualisations easier but will also give insight into some of the thinking behind D3.
