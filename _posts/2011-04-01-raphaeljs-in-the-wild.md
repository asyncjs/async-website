Ben is a front-end web developer working with digital agencies in London to produce standards based rich user experiences with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Originally from a Flash background, Ben made the 'jump' about 2 years ago and has never looked back. He blogs at http://benbarnett.net and is @benpbarnett on Twitter.

The talk:

RaphaelJS in the Wild
The session is aimed at Javascript developers who want to learn more about SVG, RaphaelJS and on making the decision on when to use these technologies. We'll cover the basics of the RaphaelJS API and explore some real world examples to give people enough information to begin writing and deploying their own applications straight away.

Broken down, the talk will cover the following;
An Introduction to RaphaelJS & SVG
Case Study 1 - recreating the London Tube Map (working with Adobe Illustrator, vector graphics and the raw SVG format)
Case Study 2 - an Avatar Builder in RaphaelJS (image layering and the benefits of using RaphaelJS)
Quick exploration around choosing the right technology; RaphaelJS, Canvas or just CSS?
