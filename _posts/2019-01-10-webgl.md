Dan Neame will be kicking off the new Async year with a talk on WebGL. Please note that it'll be on the _second_ Thursday of the month, to allow us all time recover from our festive hangover! 

Dan will be talking about the following topics in ThreeJS:

- Basics
- Geometry
- Materials
- Postprocessing

## Update

This meeting will be sponsored by [Madgex](https://madgex.com/uk/careers#vacancies), who will provide pizzas and beers for all. Please get in touch if you have any specific dietary requirements at hello AT asyncjs DOT com.
