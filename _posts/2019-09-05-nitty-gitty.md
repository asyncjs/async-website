### Main Talk

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is not complicated, but it is complex (and confusing). In this talk, Daniel explains the basic building blocks of git: commits, blobs, trees and refs. He then builds on this foundation, past branches and merges to remotes and rebases in an attempt to demystify the tool we all rely on.

Some exposure to git would be beneficial to enjoy this talk

### Lightning Talk

[Remi Shergold](https://remi-shergold.com/) will give us a lightning talk on CSS Modules

### Update

This meetup will be sponsored by [Creative Technologies](https://www.creative-technologies.co.uk), so beers and pizzas for all! If you have any dietary requirements, please get in touch at hello AT asyncjs DOT com.
