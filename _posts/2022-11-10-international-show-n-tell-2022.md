The November migration of the world's top web developers to the sunny city of Brighton & Hove can only mean one thing - [FFConf 2022](https://2022.ffconf.org/) is coming. So, it's time for another International Async Show 'n' tell! This year's installment will be _on Thursday 10th November_. The ever popular International show 'n' tell is the perfect opportunity to give a peek at your passion project, try out a lightning talk, or just share what's on your mind.
**IMPORTANT: Different date, and possibly different venue.\*\***


If you're interested in giving a talk, we'd love to hear from you. It's the perfect opportunity to give a peek at your passion project, try out a lightning talk, or just share what's on your mind. You’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web.

If you would like to grab a speaking slot, please leave a comment on the [meetup event][meetup] including:

- Your name
- Your main website, if you have one
- Twitter username, if you have one
- A sentence or two about your talk
- Any relevant links

For a spot of inspiration, take a look at our International Show n' Tells in [2021][showntell-2021], [2020][showntell-2020], [2019][showntell-2019], [2018][showntell-2018], [2017][showntell-2017], [2016][showntell-2016], [2015][showntell-2015], [2014][showntell-2014], [2013][showntell-2013], [2012][showntell-2012], [2011][showntell-2011] and [2010][showntell-2010].

You will be able to join us in-person, or online (via Zoom).

If you're thinking of joining us in-person, please sign up to the event on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/async-web-tech-meetup/events/289172125/). We also highly recommend you sign up to the [Async Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/asyncjs/shared_invite/zt-1aguxx86q-XjF_yWcFoJ8fyYYzoqgDaQ) for more info, and updates.

\*\*This event is being held on the second Thursday of the month to coincide with ffconf (instead of the first Thursday), and we may book a different venue with more space if it seems that we're getting more attendees than we could comfortably fit in the usual venue ([Spaces, Trafalgar Place](https://www.spacesworks.com/brighton/trafalgar-place/)). Make sure you're set to attend on Meetup and [join our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/asyncjs/shared_invite/zt-1aguxx86q-XjF_yWcFoJ8fyYYzoqgDaQ) for updates.
