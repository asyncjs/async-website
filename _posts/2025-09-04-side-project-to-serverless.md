On Thursday 4th September we're very happy to be joined by James Turner.

It started with wanting to explore the hype around serverless - particularly the costs. COVID was striking so James built a quick proof of concept to allow members at their local cricket club to order drinks while sitting by the boundary. The initial release consisted of a single page Svelte app, integration to Stripe and some JSON config. Roll on a few years and they have a richly featured commercial system called OrderWhizz.

In the presentation we‚Äôll look at the system architecture and technologies used and how we share TypeScript between backend Lambda functions and the (Svelte and React) UI's. We‚Äôll also discuss some of the many trade-offs made along the way, and how the design was effected by ‚Äúgoing fully serverless‚Äù. Expect some demos and a look into the code itself.

James currently runs his own web-dev consultancy and has been building web-apps for "longer that he cares to remember", having developed one of the first browser based FX trading systems (on IE6 no less).

üçï Pizzas provided by our venue! Runway East has been fighting boring offices since 2014. Members get team bliss guaranteed with space to scale. [Learn more](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship).

üçª BYOB: We are currently looking for additional sponsorship. This event will likely not have a sponsor for drinks, so if you'd like to have a couple during the event please bring some of your own (and maybe some to share if you're feeling generous).

You will be able to join us in-person at [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship) or online (link added closer to the event).
