In the early days of CSS the web industry cut its teeth on blogs and small
personal sites. Much of the methodology still considered best-practise today
originated from the experiences of developers working alone, often on a single
small style sheet, with few of the constraints that come from working with
large distributed teams on large continually changing web projects.

The mechanics of CSS are relatively simple. But creating large maintainable
systems with it is still an unsolved problem. For larger sites, CSS is a
difficult and complex component of the codebase to manage and maintain. It’s
difficult to document patterns, and it’s difficult for developers unfamiliar
with the code to contribute safely.

How can we do better? What are the CSS best practises that are letting us down
and that we must shake off? How can we take a more precise, structured,
engineering-driven approach to writing CSS to keep it bug-free, performant, and
most importantly, maintainable?
