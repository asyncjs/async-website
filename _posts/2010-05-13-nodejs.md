[Add yourself to the event on Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/5858611/BRI/Hove/Getting-started-with-Nodejs-Simon-Willison/The-Werks/), so we have an idea of numbers.

First off the mark...

Did you ever want to use your client-side skills to let rip on the server? Or are you a back-end developer who wants to add JavaScript to your server-side toolkit? Then this is the event for you.

This 90 minute workshop will provide a thorough developer's introduction to [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

### About Node.js

Node is an extremely high performance server-side programming framework based on <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>'s lightning fast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)">V8 engine</a>. It solves the same problems as server-side tools such as PHP, Django or Ruby on Rails, using JavaScript as the programming language and with a focus on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_I/O">non-blocking</a>, highly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)">concurrent</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing)">t</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing)">event-based</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">I/O</a>.

This makes it an excellent fit for problems requiring long-running connections - things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">Comet</a>, <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2009/12/web-sockets-now-available-in-google.html">HTML5 WebSockets</a>, large file uploads and combining results from unpredictable third party web services. As a result, Node makes an excellent complement to existing server-side technologies.

<h3>What you'll learn</h3>
The workshop is aimed at developers with some experience of both JavaScript and basic server-side programming in a language such as PHP, Python, Ruby or ASP.NET.

It will cover the fundamentals of development with Node, then use those basic principles to build scalable solutions for real-world problems: pushing data to the browser with comet, robustly combining web services at scale, and adding rate limiting and caching to existing web applications using a Node-powered reverse proxy.

Client-side developers should come away from the session with an understanding of how they can take their existing skills and apply them to server-side development, while server-side developers should gain a powerful new set of tools for solving problems that their current platform may not be able handle.
