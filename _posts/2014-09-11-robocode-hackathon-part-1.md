###Join us for part one of a two-part hackathon and pit your robo-tank in a battle royale!

We’re looking for coders and artists to join forces in making an army of individualistic robot tanks who will look, behave, and fight how you decide.

The bots will be programmed in JavaScript, but we welcome novice and expert coders alike; try using genetic algorithms to evolve a neural network brain, or simply chuck in a bunch of random commands and cross your fingers, there’s no telling what the best strategy will be so the proof will be in the pudding!

We’re also looking for talented artists to give the tank fighters some visual flair (they’re rather uniform at the moment), and create some wonderful backdrops for the carnage. So even if programming is alien to you, do please pop along and make your mark.

This event is part of the [Brighton Digital Festival](http://www.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk).

Pizzas will be supplied by local tech company [Brandwatch](http://www.brandwatch.com), and the event will be supported and hosted by the good folk at [68 Middle Street](http://68middle.st).
