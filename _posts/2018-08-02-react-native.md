Over the recent years, various attempts have been made to bring app development to the web development community, with varying degrees of success and popularity. Facebook's offering asks devs to leverage their knowledge of React and its ecosystem, but ditch the DOM, to allow for frictionless development of performant iOS and Android apps. However, with their "learn once, write anywhere" approach, is React Native really as straightforward as the marketing blurb would have you believe? In this talk, we'll cover how easy it is to get your React Native code running on a real device, offer a primer to the React and JSX way of life, and discuss some of the hurdles you might come across.

## UPDATE:

This meetup will now be sponsored by the good folk at [Prodpad](http://www.prodpad.com/about-us/jobs/), so beers and pizzas for all! If you have any dietary requirements, please get in touch at <a href="mailto:hello@asyncjs.com">hello@asyncjs.com</a>
