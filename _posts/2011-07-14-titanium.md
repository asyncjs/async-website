<p><a href="http://www.appcelerator.com">Appcelerator Titanium</a> is a framework for creating cross-platform, native mobile apps for iOS (iPhone/ iPad/ iPod) and Android devices, using JavaScript as its programming language.</p>

<p>With Titanium, JavaScript developers get to use their existing skills, rather than needing to learn Objective-C for iOS, plus Java for Android. They can achieve this by writing and maintaining just a single codebase for both platforms.</p>

<p>This Async session, with <a href="http://twitter.com/fluffyemily">Emily Toop</a>, is aimed at JavaScripters interested in developing mobile apps of their own. Titanium requires no experience in web technologies beyond JavaScript, so there is no fiddling around with CSS and HTML (and here lies the main difference with <a href="http://asyncjs.com/phonegap/">PhoneGap</a>, which gives a full HTML/CSS/JavaScript web app environment). We'll also discuss <a href="https://github.com/kwhinnery/Helium">Helium</a>, a framework for use with Titanium that provides a modular approach to the codebase, with unit and user-interface testing.</p>

<p>Emily is a mobile application developer working as a freelancer in Brighton. She develops iOS and Android applications both natively, and with cross-platform technologies like PhoneGap and Titanium.</p>
