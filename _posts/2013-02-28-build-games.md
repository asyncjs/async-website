With the advent of HTML5 it is now possible to build games that run in the browser, plugin free, on multiple devices. Ever wanted to make your own game but weren't sure where to start? Or maybe you've built a few games before for desktop and are interested in the challenges involved in building one in the browser?

In this talk, [Dan Neame][cham] will look at what's involved in building your own tile-based HTML5 game and patterns we as web developers can apply to them, from renderers to gamepads to map generators. And of course, the most entertaining commit messages you will ever write.

Dan is a JavaScript programmer working at [Brandwatch][bw] who has been building games when he's not at work for the last couple of years, and playing them for even longer.
