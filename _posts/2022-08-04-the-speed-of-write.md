We're back at [Spaces](https://www.spacesworks.com/brighton/trafalgar-place/) this coming Thursday for an event that we don't believe we've had anything quite like before.

As with our previous event you will be able to join us in-person, or online (via Zoom).

On Thursday the 4th of August our very own [Jake 'Sid' Smith](https://twitter.com/JakeSidSmith) - long time Async attendee and now co-organizer - will be running a session on how to improve your coding proficiency by better utilizing the tools at your disposal.

For the first part of the session Jake will be covering some tools, settings, shortcuts, and editor extensions you might not know about, that can help improve your coding quality, speed, and how you work collaboratively. These will mostly center around VSCode, but many will be applicable to other popular editors. There'll also be some live demos and if there's time, briefly cover some other tools that you can use alongside your editor.

After this initial demo we'll open the floor for others to suggest ways in which we can improve how we code - shortcuts, extensions, other tools, etc, have a chat, and demo some of the suggestions. Hopefully by the end of the session everyone will have at least a few little things to take from this to make their development experience easier.

As always we welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along.

If you're thinking of joining us in-person, please sign up to the event on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/async-web-tech-meetup/events/287513925/). We also highly recommend you sign up to the [Async Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/asyncjs/shared_invite/zt-1aguxx86q-XjF_yWcFoJ8fyYYzoqgDaQ) for more info, and updates.
