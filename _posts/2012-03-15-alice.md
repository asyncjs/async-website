<p><a href="http://blackberry.github.com/Alice">AliceJS</a> is an open source JavaScript library to <span class="summary">create advanced animations with CSS</span>. Itâ€™s self-contained and works directly against the DOM to support a variety of use cases for web applications.</p>

<p>With one line of JavaScript, you can make almost any DOM elements swerve around the page, yet retain control over the animation's parameters. The framework also introduces the concept of <em>Organics</em>, adding randomisation characteristics to create visual effects that are subtly different each time. Useful for games and business apps alike, AliceJS can bring freshness and polish to your work in a very simple and straightforward manner.</p>
