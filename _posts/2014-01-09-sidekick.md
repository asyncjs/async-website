If you're going to be creating a business, it better be doing something you love. When [Tim Ruffles][tim] saw a possible business building code-quality tools he jumped at the chance.

Here, he shares his experiences of building [SidekickJS][sidekick] over the last 10 months. He's learned a lot about Software as a Service (SaaS), code-quality, talking to customers, how developers think about paying for things and how to go solo without also simultaneously going bankrupt or mad.
