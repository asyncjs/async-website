On Thursday 2nd October we're very happy to be hearing from Chetan Padia - Head of Software at Clockwork Dog.

Sandboxed Javascript: letting users run their own Javascript code in our product.

Allowing users to write their own code in your application is incredibly powerful but it's important to be wary of performance and security. This talk goes through the sandboxed Javascript implementation in COGS, how users learn it, and how it's locked down.

[COGS](https://cogs.show/) is a software and hardware platform for building immersive theatre and escape room experiences.

üçï Pizzas provided by our venue! Runway East has been fighting boring offices since 2014. Members get team bliss guaranteed with space to scale. [Learn more](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship).

üçª BYOB: We are currently looking for additional sponsorship. This event will likely not have a sponsor for drinks, so if you'd like to have a couple during the event please bring some of your own (and maybe some to share if you're feeling generous).

You will be able to join us in-person at [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship) or online (link added closer to the event).
