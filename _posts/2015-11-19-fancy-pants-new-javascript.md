It's [Tom Parslow][tom] again, this time talking about the new features of JavaScript known as ES2015 (previously ES6) and ES7.

JavaScript is changing! Shorter function syntax, syntax for classes,
template strings, destructuring assignment and much more. I hope to show that while it is
a bit more to learn it also lets you write clearer and more succinct
code.

I'll show and explain lots of the new features and syntax and talk
about browser support today as well as how you can use tools like
[Babel][babel] and polyfills to use some of the otherwise unsupported
features today.

I'm going to assume that you've used JavaScript before but the talk should be useful to a range of skill levels.
