You've surely heard of them, the bots are coming! Some predict they will cause the end of mobile applications, others that they will even take over jobs!

Throughout this talk, we will try to answer many questions about the rise of the bots: Who are they? Why such enthusiasm? Can they really take over the world of mobile applications?

The talk will also include a tutorial so you can start building your own bots on Facebook Messenger using api.ai and node.js!
