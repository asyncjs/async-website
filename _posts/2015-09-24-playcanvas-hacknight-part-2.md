Come and learn how to create your very own 3D Lunar Lander game using web technologies

For this year’s [Brighton Digital Festival][bdf], we’re continuing with our [tradition][robocode] of [Hacknights][jungle]. This year, we will be using the powerful [PlayCanvas][playcanvas] platform to create a Lunar Lander game in 3D.

If you haven’t used PlayCanvas before, we’ll have a skeleton app and a tutorial/support on the night from the creators of the platform themselves.

Please bring your own laptop. If you don't have one, then it's likely you could pair program with somebody but do please bring one if you have it.

This is part 2 of a 2 part series but there will be help and support for those that missed the first event
