### Main Talk

Ever wondered how to implement editors in the browser? What about repeatable and reversible changes, rich text, syntax highlighting, mixing text with arbitrary content or god forbid - editing recursive data structures as text?


Julian has been obsessing over questions like these for a few years now and is ready to share and discuss his findings. Expect demos, code examples, some talk about design, lots of opinions and maybe even a little fun!

Audience expectations: Intermediate JavaScript knowledge, some familiarity with React would be great too.

### Lightning Talk
