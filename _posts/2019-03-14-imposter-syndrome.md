Imposter syndrome. You may have heard of it. You may have suffered from it. You might not even have realised it at the time.

This talk will explore a journey through imposter syndrome: recognition, acceptance and coping strategies.

Disclaimer: It won't contain a magic cure, but hopefully some of it will help!
