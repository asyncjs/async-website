[Brandwatch Vizia](https://www.brandwatch.com/brandwatch-vizia) is a multi-screen data visualisation system, the second product that Brandwatch released. It uses the Brandwatch platform to present data in an attractive and simple manner.

Dan has been leading the techical team since the beginning of the project. In this talk Dan will explain the 4 year history of Brandwatch Vizia, and what he's learnt along the way. Dan will talk about how the project has evolved from a single app to a service oriented platform, from a team of 3 to 16, the challenges met along the way, and what the future looks like.
