It's that time of year again in Brighton, when the heady seaside summer makes way for the dark introspection of winter, alack.

But cheer up! We have the warm solace of the [Full Frontal][ff] conference in our midst and, as ever, [Async][async] is here to get the ball rolling and the blood flowing. With arms wide open, we welcome home our long-lost cousins from the far-flung east, the frozen north, the way out west, and the rhythmic south. This is the 2012 International Show n' Tell.

If you'd like to attend, just sign up on the [Lanyrd event page][event-lanyrd].

And, _if you'd like to grab a speaking slot_ (and why not?!), you'll have five minutes, that's 300 seconds, to tell us about somethingâ€¦ a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else on JavaScript and its techy friends (HTML, CSS, SVG, animated GIFs), or the wider world of web. We hope to bring a glorious blend of local truth, with some insight from the outside world. Ee by gum.

For a spot of inspiration, take a look at our International Show n' Tells in [2010][showntell-2010] and [2011][showntell-2011]. We've also hosted local show n' tells: [1][birthday-2], [2][birthday-1], [3][showntell-2], [4][showntell-1].

**If you're up for speaking**, then please [add a comment to this gist][comments], and we'll be in touch to confirm.
