Offline is the new frontier for those building on the web. The things we build have become more complex, beyond what anyone could have envisioned when the web was invented or in its early years, and delivering "app-like" experiences with always available data is vital.

Currently, we take the user's connection for granted: "they'll be on wifi, or 3G... probably, won't they? And if they aren't, well, there's nothing we can do."

Device-native platforms hold this over the web. We do not have any meaningful method of ensuring that, no matter what the connection of the user is like, we can deliver content. or at least fall-back to something better than "Safari could not load this page."

[ServiceWorker](https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker), in the wake off the ill-featured AppCache, aims to make concrete our access to this twilight-zone of the web: offline. Tom will talk through the state of things today; the ServiceWorker proposal and possible future directions.

Tom is a JavaScript developer from Brighton, working at Twitter in London.
