For those who haven't heard of us, [codebar][codebar] is a non-profit initiative that facilitates the growth of a diverse tech community by running regular programming workshops. The atmosphere at each weekly codebar meeting is pretty special – a great mix of catching-up, idea sharing and learning. In addition to meeting weekly, we work hard to offer interesting and exciting events and workshops.

Come down for an upbeat evening of code demos, stories and inspiration sharing from our latest event; a [whole][weekend1] [weekend][weekend2] of creative coding, held as part of Brighton Digital Festival.
Everyone is welcome to come along. If you have ever thought about becoming a student or a coach at codebar, it’d be a great time to see what we do and ask us questions!
