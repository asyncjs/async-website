And so it begins.

I've had in my mind to get a JavaScript group going in Brighton for over a year now, and never quite made the time for it. Well, the time is now.

There's a huge interest in JavaScript at the moment. We're seeing a <a href="http://apirocks.com/html5/html5.html#slide1">groundbreaking collection</a> of new features for browser-based applications (let's just collectively call it 'HTML5'), not least for <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/03/html5_apps.html">mobile apps</a>. The browser manufactures are competing head-on with the speed of their latest and greatest JavaScript engines (<a title="Firefox" href="http://antonywilliams.com/blog/2010/03/09/mozillas-comeback-in-javascript-performance/">1</a>, <a title="Safari" href="http://gizmodo.com/5283295/safari-4-available-now-dubbed-worlds-fastest-browser">2</a>, <a title="Opera" href="http://geektechnica.com/2009/12/move-over-chrome-opera-now-has-the-fastest-js-engine/">3</a>, <a title="Internet Explorer" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2010/05/05/html5-and-same-markup-second-ie9-platform-preview-available-for-developers.aspx">4</a>, <a title="Chrome" href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/05/pedal-to-chrome-metal-our-fastest-beta.html">5</a>). And there's a renaissance happening <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Nov/23/node/">on the server</a>, with the realisation that JavaScript's event-based model is ideal for the requirements of web applications (e.g. real-time updates to clients, distributed APIs, traffic spike handling).

JavaScript is everywhere. Even the most die-hard back-end developer may have to touch <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> or something similar from time to time. And a little more knowledge goes a long way.

So, in order to build up our core skills, to stay up-to-date with new developments, to learn from each other, to meet, collaborate and support a new generation of JavaScript developers, the Async meetup group has been created.

I've got some ideas about how it might work. For example, I'd love for it to be hands-on and practical, and not only informative. But if it's to succeed, it's direction will need to come from the community.

There are now a few different communication channels for the event. Time will tell which ones prove to be most useful:
<ul>
    <li>The blog: <a href="https://asyncjs.com">asyncjs.com</a> (<a href="https://asyncjs.com/feed/">subscribe to the feed</a>, or <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=asyncjs">subscribe by email</a>)</li>
    <li>Twitter account for announcements: <a href="http://twitter.com/asyncjs">follow @asyncjs</a> (and use the <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23asyncjs">#asyncjs hashtag</a>)</li>
    <li>Google group for discussion: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/asyncjs/">groups.google.com/group/asyncjs/</a></li>
    <li>Individual events announced on Upcoming:  <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/tag/asyncjs/">upcoming.yahoo.com/tag/asyncjs/</a></li>
</ul>
