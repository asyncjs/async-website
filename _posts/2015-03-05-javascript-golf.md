Get on your best pair of hideous golfing trousers and join us for the first ever _Async JS Golf Competition_.

The rules are simple. Solve the challenge in as fewer (key)strokes as possible to win the game, the adulation of your peers, and maybe even a sweetie.

Bring a laptop if you can, but we'll be forming into teams so come along even if you don't have access to one. Or, if you _really_ love a challenge, you could do it all in your head and draw up your answer on the whiteboard!

All levels of coder are welcome for an educational and entertaining evening. See you there!
