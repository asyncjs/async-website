The highly anticipated feature of React Hooks has finally been released. We can now add state and use side effects in our functional React components.

We are going to take a look at the precursors to Hooks, then learn about how Hooks work and how to use them to improve our React apps.

This meetup will be sponsored by Creative Technologies, so beers and pizzas for all! If you have any dietary requirements, please get in touch at hello AT asyncjs DOT com.
