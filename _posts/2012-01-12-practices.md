<p>For the first session of 2012, we are getting back to fundamentals to present what we hope will be <span class="summary">the first in a series of jQuery best practice sessions</span>. Whether you are new to jQuery or simply want to address some bad habits, then this is for you.</p>

<p>Our speaker for the evening will be <a href="http://skyapperley.co.uk">Sky Apperley</a>. Sky is a freelance front-end developer and <a href="http://skyapp.co.uk/dbug/">iPhone app developer</a>. His talk will be useful to beginners and intermediate jQuery users alike. It will include some useful practices and tips for using the browser's developer tools and debug console, using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">Content Delivery Network</a>, testing new code, optimising <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/">jQuery selectors</a> and avoiding unnecessary code duplication.</p>

<p>Towards the end of this session, we are hoping to get a new regular slot off the ground, '<em>Plugin Roundabout</em>' - a condensed version of our "<a href="http://asyncjs.com/jquery/" title="#34: My Favourite jQuery Plugin">Favourite jQuery Plugin</a>" session, where the group shared information about favourite plugins. So do come along and bring your discoveries.</p>
