How can you set developers up for success? Think like an English teacher.

The days of grammar drills and awkward roleplays may be behind us, but there’s more than a passing similarity between learning a foreign language and learning to code. Just like English, French and Klingon, programming languages like JavaScript and Go are underpinned by systems (grammar and vocabulary) and skills (reading and writing), so why shouldn’t we use the same approach to teach them?

Drawing on my own experience teaching English as a foreign language, I’ll take you through some of the most useful language-teaching techniques and how you can use them in a technical context - whether you're coaching a new developer on your team, or writing documentation for a bank employing hundreds of developers.
