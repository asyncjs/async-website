And now for something a little different. This session, the content will be in your hands. Rather than having one speaker speaking on one topic, we'll be covering a range of topics chosen on the night, and leveraging the power of the mighty brains of Async to demystify, enlighten, and wax lyrical. The session will be run by Steve Hughes; further details coming soon.
