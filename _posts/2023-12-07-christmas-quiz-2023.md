Back by popular demand, Quizmasters Alise & Michal bring a fresh instalment of the Async Christmas Quiz. Join us as we wind down on the year's final first-Thursday-of-the-month in festive December, and we reflect on another fabulous and varied year of Async meetups. Note this event will be in-person only.

As with previous years, this won’t be a test of how much JavaScript you know. It’s more like a traditional pub quiz that promises to be humbling at any stage of your career. Come one, come all to this earnest contest for the ultimate prize of trivial knowledge!
