We hope for our web applications to be as beautiful, performant, and accessible as possible; but sometimes... Things get in the way and the outcome is not as good as we hoped. In this talk, I will walk you through a few of my failed attempts at developing accessible web applications. We'll go through different accessibility assumptions and myths that I wrongly believed to be true and how to avoid them by properly testing for accessibility.
