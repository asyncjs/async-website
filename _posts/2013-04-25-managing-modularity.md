The Model-View-Controller (MVC) model has been widely adopted for building client-side Javascript apps, but how does this architecture scale as complexity increases? Is MVC the right choice after all?

In this talk, Tom will present: 

* an overview of modular architectures
* the problem he's trying to solve
* how he approached it (with some crazy diagrams)
 
In the second part of the evening, Tom will open up the floor to the audience to discuss and improve on various ideas.

We'll take a journey into sandboxes and mediators, deeply nested models and views, and the complex data dependecies of a game - all within the context of RequireJS and Backbone.
