_... be with you._

Two timescales have aligned. It's been a whole decade since our memorable [Nodeventure][nodeventure] and our next session lands on Star Wars day. Time for a reboot of this Async franchise!

Nodeventure is a multiplayer [Text Adventure][ifiction] collaborated in real-time. We'll start with text and a Star Wars themed storyline and bring an adventure to life.

This a chance to work with others on a creative group project, no programming experience necessary. There are two sessions: [4th May][event-1] and [11th May][event-2]. Feel free to come to both or either.

WRITERS: Write inspiring descriptions of rooms and objects...  
ARTISTS: Bring beauty to the world through design...  
PROGRAMMERS: Extend our super simple game engine...  
EVERYONE: Help us shape a New Order!
