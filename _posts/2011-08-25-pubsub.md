<p class="summary"><strong>Events, also known as the publish/subscribe pattern, are a common idiom used throughout JavaScript.</strong> They are used to notify other objects about changes that may be acted upon (such as the browser events "<strong>click</strong>", "<strong>load</strong>" and "<strong>submit</strong>") and work very well with the asynchronous nature of JavaScript. They are a useful coding pattern to help keep JavaScript objects modular, reusable and easily extensible.</p>

<p><strong>In this session, <a href="http://aroncarroll.com">Aron Carroll</a> will take us through examples of event usage in the wild</strong>, such as the DOM's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener">.addEventListener()</a> and jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/">.ajax()</a> methods. We will then look at building a simple example using jQuery to handle the events, and finish up with an overview of other libraries that could be used in our own code.</p>
