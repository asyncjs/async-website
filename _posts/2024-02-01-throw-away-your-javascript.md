Are you tired of building simple web apps using complex JavaScript frameworks? Would you like to get back to the good old days of server-rendered applications, but worried that you'll lose responsiveness and interactivity?

Tools like HTMX, Hotwire and Livewire represent a new paradigm for creating web applications. They let you build simple but powerful apps, using the bare minimum of client-side JavaScript, and building on the strengths of the browser.

Expect a brief but ill-informed overview of the history of web development, a demonstration of what these new tools can do and thoughts on whether they might be right for your next project.
