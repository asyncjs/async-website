<p class="summary vcard">A crash course in debugging JavaScript in the browser, with <a class="url fn" href="http://twitter.com/aroncarroll">Aron Carroll</a>.</p>

<p>Nobody writes perfect code on the first attempt, so it's important to be able to locate and fix bugs quickly. Fortunately all modern browsers have tools to inspect our code and find errors with ease.</p>

<p>In this session, we'll take a look at the browser's console and debugger to pause running JavaScript with 'breakpoints' and step through the code in order to find the source of an error. We will see how to get the most out of the Web Inspector in <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/1Introduction/Introduction.html">Safari</a> and <a href="http://www.chromium.org/devtools">Chrome</a>, as well as the popular <a href="http://getfirebug.com">Firebug</a> add-on for Firefox.</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>
<p>Aron's <a href="http://aron.github.com/async-debugging-talk/">slides from the session</a> are now online.</p>
