In this session, we take a look through the process of building a rich
full-stack Javascript application, API-first.

Local polyglot developer, [Tom Parslow][#tom] ([@almostobsolete][#twitter]),
will demonstrate how building a [RESTful API][#rest] as a base can have some
surprising, positive effects on the design of a system. As a case study, he’ll
show us around an application he built with [Dharmafly][#dharmafly] that serves
a self-describing API with a full-stack JavaScript app, built using
[Node.js][#node], [Backbone][#backbone], [CoffeeScript][#cs] and
[CouchDB][#couch].
