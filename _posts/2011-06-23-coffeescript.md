  <p>Thanks to a resurgence in popularity with server-side and rich HTML apps, developers are writing more JavaScript than ever. While there are numerous libraries to improve some of its quirks, there remain <a href="http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/">language-level idiosyncrasies</a> that those libraries cannot remedy.</p>

  <p><a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeesScript</a> is a transparent [ruby|perl]esque bridge language that disguises these inconsistencies and helps you write terse, readable and maintainable code. Its documentation describes it as “an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way”.</p>

  <p>What makes this particularly interesting to anyone who uses JavaScript in their day to day life is the impact that CoffeeScript is having on the JavaScript language itself as <a href="http://brendaneich.com/2010/11/paren-free/">proposals are</a> <a href="http://brendaneich.com/2011/05/my-jsconf-us-presentation/">being made</a> to add CoffeeScript features into JavaScript.</p>

  <p>In this session, <a href="http://twitter.com/purge">Simon Elliot</a> will be talking about his move to using CoffeeScript and what he’s learned in the transition. The talk will look at the language itself, getting started and installation, some real-world examples and thoughts on what the future holds.</p>

  <p>Simon is a freelance developer living in Brighton. He’s been developing Javascript for far too many years and hopes to never see ===, prototype.constructor, apply or function ever again. His favourite language is Perl which is terribly misunderstood and he will fight anyone who says otherwise.</p>
