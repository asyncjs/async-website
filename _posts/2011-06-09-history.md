  <p>Bots are people too… Alright, they're not, but they still want access to your content.</p>

  <p>This session, led by <a href="http://twitter.com/sydlawrence">Syd Lawrence</a>, will show us how to create accessible and indexable dynamic content using the <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/history.html">HTML5 History API</a>.</p>

  <p>The History API lets you create websites and apps that modify the URL in the browser's location bar without causing the page to reload. This is great for loading in parts of a site <em>dynamically</em> while keeping the URL up-to-date. This lets users continue to bookmark and share links, allows search engines to index the content, and provides a more responsive experience by only loading in new content as needed.</p>

  <p><a href="http://sydlawrence.me">Syd Lawrence</a> is a freelance developer (previously of <a href="http://www.marmaladeontoast.co.uk">Marmalade on Toast</a>) and a part-time lecturer at the University of Winchester in BSc Development for Digital Media.</p>
