On Thursday 7th August we're very happy to be joined by Noam Rosenthal. Noam works for Google in the Chrome team, currently focusing on paint/compositing/rendering. He is the editor of the CSS shapes and borders specs.

`shape()`, `corner-shape`, `border-shape` - three new features in CSS, one shipped in multiple browsers, one shipped in chromium very soon, one in the works.

We will understand what ideas they help express, how they work, how they complement each other and what's missing.
