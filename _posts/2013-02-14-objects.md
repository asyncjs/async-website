Object proxies and observables are frequently seen in [MVC][mvc] frameworks - some background reading: [here][observe], [here][observables] and [here][proxies] - but you can also make use of them to simplify and automate common programming problems. In [ES6 and ES7][harmony] there will be improved language support to help make this form of meta-programming more accessible.

In this talk, [Kevin Jones][kevin] will look at how to use the new features by example and show how he built a _shared object_ module for distributed Node.js applications that exploits meta-programming ideas to make it absurdly easy to use.

Kevin is a freelance developer working out of Harrogate, North Yorkshire. He is a data runtime specialist who is often to be found building interpreters, virtual machines and parallel processing engines for the likes of Intel & HMRC. He is currently obsessed with all things Node, but worryingly actually quite likes [TypeScript][typescript].
