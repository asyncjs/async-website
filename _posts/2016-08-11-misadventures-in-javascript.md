Pete will give you a whistlestop tour of the many weird (and pointless) experiments he has created over the years, built with a mixture of web technologies, a misguided imagination and a bit too much alcohol. Hopefully there will be a laugh or two along the way. 

This talk is aimed at anyone who has an interest in the web - designers and developers alike. By the end we hope you'll be inspired to create your very own pointless experiments.

_About the speaker_

Pete Goodman has been tinkering with code for years, and sometimes even manages to convince people to pay him to build something. See more information on his [website](http://petegoodman.com)
