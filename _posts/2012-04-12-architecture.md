Join us for a tour of a real-world JavaScript application. For the best part
of a year, the team at [Brandwatch][#brandwatch] have been rewriting their
legacy JavaScript front-end, relying heavily on [Backbone][#backbone],
[RequireJS][#require] and [Jasmine][#jasmine] to get the job done, as well as
some [NodeJS][#node] magic.

Learn the tools and concepts behind these new shiny frameworks, as well as
what lessons were learned from maintaining a legacy application collapsing
under the weight of its own design choices.

[Steve Mason][#homepage] ([@spmason][#twitter]) is a JavaScript Developer at
Brandwatch. He's a regular contributor to various [open source
projects][#github] and is preparing to release Brandwatch's first proper
JavaScript library - tabler.
