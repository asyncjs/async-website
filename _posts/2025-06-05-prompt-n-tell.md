Now is the decade software engineers go extinct&hellip; or is it? OpenAI's $3B acquisition of Windfall and Cursor's $9B valuation, two companies built upon forks of VS Code, indicates copiloting as a likely future. Whereas the recent bankruptcy filing by Builder.ai may spell the beginning of the end for vibe coding at scale.

Between AI-enriched IDEs or agents in your pull requests, what's actually useful today? What shows promise? And what is just good marketing with no real basis? Tell us about new tools or workflows you've adopted that have had an impact on the quality or speed of writing code.

If you would like to share your own prompt engineering discoveries, please leave a comment on the [meetup event][meetup] including:

- Your name
- Your main website, if you have one
- Where to find you on the socials
- A sentence or two about your talk
- Any relevant links

We welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along.

Pizzas provided by our venue! Runway East has been fighting boring offices since 2014. Members get team bliss guaranteed with space to scale. [Learn more][runway-east].

BYOB: We are currently looking for additional sponsorship. This event will likely not have a sponsor for drinks, so if you'd like to have a couple during the event please bring some of your own (and maybe some to share if you're feeling generous).
