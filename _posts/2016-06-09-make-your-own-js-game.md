We all love a good game, don't we? I've got some good news for you, making games is almost as fun as playing them, and you can do this entirely in JavaScript.

The browsers have improved so much recently that we have the ability to make fully-fledged cross-platform games using the world's most popular programming language.

You will learn some of the core components of game development, how they are applied to the web and will walk out with a responsive prototype that you can play on any relatively recent device.

Prerequisites:

- A laptop, ideally with a web server installed
- Entry level knowledge of JavaScript

We will cover:

- Components that make a game
- Animating using requestAnimationFrame
- How to use a game framework

### Update

This meeting is sponsored by [Brandwatch][brandwatch], who will provide pizzas and beers for all. Please get in touch if you have any specific dietary requirements at hello AT asyncjs DOT com
