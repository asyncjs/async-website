Designing for humans - demystifying the user experience domain and developing a useful design rationale.

## What is the talk about?

Developers often feedback to me that UX can be a bit of a black box. Tools and tips are easy to find online, but often the higher principles remain covered in a fog. In reality, UX is quite accessible and is grounded in some simple principles. This talk is a primer for some of those principles.

What is a human? How do we think and feel? How do we operate in the world around us, and why does that make us feel emotion? How does design work on humans, and what is good design made from?

We'll talk about the higher principles, the why that informs the whats and hows of your processes. We will discuss aspects of perception and the mind/body relationship. We will talk about the history of user experience design as a discipline. We will talk about making things that people will like.

## Is this talk for me?

You do not need to be an expert to enjoy this talk. This talk is for people who create products, who want to understand the higher principles of design, and how to translate that into value, engagement and positive bonds with users.

## What do I need to bring?

If you have questions or can recall problems from past projects, please bring those notes along and we can discuss them afterwards.
