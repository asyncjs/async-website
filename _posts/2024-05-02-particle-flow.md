[Peter Cook](https://www.peterrcook.com/) will show how to create particle flow animations. These use similar techniques to visualisations such as the [hint.fm wind map](http://hint.fm/wind/) and Cameron Beccario's [wind map](https://earth.nullschool.net/).

Peter will show how to build a particle flow animation from first principles. He'll take you on a step by step journey, starting with a single particle. He'll explain vectors, velocity fields, particle animation, the Canvas element and `requestAnimationFrame`.

All concepts will be explained and demonstrated - it's not as difficult as you might imagine. This should be a fun and educational evening for new and seasoned developers!

This is primarily a talk, rather than a workshop, so there's no need to bring a laptop. However you'll be able to explore the examples if you do have a laptop with you.

Peter's a data visualisation developer at [Flourish (Canva)](https://flourish.studio/). He also makes [training courses and books](https://www.createwithdata.com/) on data visualisation. He runs [D3 in Depth](https://www.d3indepth.com/) and [Create With Data](https://www.createwithdata.com/), self published the book [D3 Start to Finish](https://www.createwithdata.com/d3-start-to-finish-book/) and recently launched the video course [Visualising Data with JavaScript](https://www.createwithdata.com/visualising-data-with-javascript/).

We welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along.
