<h3>Canvas everything</h3>
In this session, <a href="http://twitter.com/binarytales">Jon Linklater-Johnson</a> will be teaching us all how to draw, using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element">Canvas element</a>, which is part of the <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html5">HTML5</a> suite of new web technologies.

Jon will cover almost everything you need to know about the Canvas API, with a look at <a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.js</a> and maybe one or two of the other drawing frameworks. We'll look at why <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> might sometimes be a better for your project and how <a href="http://raphaeljs.com">RaphaÃ«l.js</a> can help. Finishing up with some demos of the crazy cool stuff that people have built and how they did it.
<h3>Difficulty level</h3>
<em>Jon says:</em>

<blockquote>The session should be fairly easy for anyone that already knows a bit of Javascript. I think it will end up being about 50/50 practical/theoretical. My plan is to 'live code' my presentation as I go so hopefully if people want to they can follow along, at least for the first half, as I want to explore some more complex and crazy stuff towards the end and do some demos of other stuff people have built which will be more theoretical.</blockquote>
