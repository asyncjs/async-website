Ever wanted to break someoneâ€™s app with a single well placed ðŸ’©?

Join us on an adventure though Unicode, UTF-8, glyphs and grapheme clusters.

On Thursday the 1st of September [Remi Shergold](https://remi-shergold.com), web developer and long time Async attendee, shows us ten ways text processing can go wrong.

As always we welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along.

You will be able to join us in-person at [Spaces](https://www.spacesworks.com/brighton/trafalgar-place/), or online (via Zoom).

If you're thinking of joining us in-person, please sign up to the event on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/async-web-tech-meetup/events/287513925/). We also highly recommend you sign up to the [Async Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/asyncjs/shared_invite/zt-1aguxx86q-XjF_yWcFoJ8fyYYzoqgDaQ) for more info, and updates.
