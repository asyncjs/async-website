###Talk details TBC

Tom Ashworth from Twitter returns to Async to deliver a mystery talk. Will it include ClosureScript? Will it be functional? Details coming soon, but if you caught his previous talks on the [Service Worker](http://asyncjs.com/serviceworker/) or [Modularity](http://asyncjs.com/managing-modularity/) you'll know that this will not be one to miss!
