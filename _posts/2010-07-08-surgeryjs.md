<a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6580215/BRI/Hove/Async-JavaScript-Surgery/The-Werks/">Please add yourself to the event on Upcoming</a>

Have you got a JavaScript problem you need fixing? Or something that you don't understand?

Or do you just simply like talking about and sharing help with JavaScript?

This informal session is all about giving and receiving help. Or simply getting together with your co-scripters.

Let the surgery begin...
