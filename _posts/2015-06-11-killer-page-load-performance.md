Users don’t wait for slow sites to load, and they’re only getting more and more impatient. How do we keep up? The good news is that we can get very far by focusing on our perceived load time (as opposed to full page load time).

In this talk we will cover what every browser needs to sort out before it can start rendering a web page, and how we can use this knowledge to improve page render performance dramatically. We will cover the basic techniques and some practical examples to show exactly how this can be implemented on your site - no matter the complexity. Your site will be faster than ever!

### UPDATE

We'll also be giving away two tickets to [Cold Front Conference](https://coldfrontconf.com/) in Copenhagen, make sure to put your name in the hat to be in with a chance!
