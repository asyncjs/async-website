Web Components, or Custom HTML tags, allow us to create our own custom HTML tags that are native to the browser. They can be used as a modular library for organisations, or be used to create complete applications using 'the platform'.

They are used like regular HTML tags so can be built in to JS Frameworks. Furthermore, many JS Frameworks enable their components to be exported as Web Components. This gives us the possibility to create apps that contain many different frameworks that do not just exist with each other, but can interact with each other.

In this talk, we will look at what Web Components are and how they can be made. We will look at the architecture of a multi-framework app.

A video of using Web Components to convert a monolithic app into a set of micro-apps/services is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpTPcIlWjA4
