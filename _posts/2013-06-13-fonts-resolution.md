## Part 1: Responsive Web Fonts
[Richard Rutter][richard] will discuss web fonts in a responsive context. He’ll demonstrate the different techniques available for optimum loading (or not) of web fonts and talk through the options around fallback fonts and other such implications.

## Part 2: The Edge of the Web
Graphic designers have long honed their craft to meet the specific constraints of television. As web designers begin to understand the true nature of our own medium, isn’t about time we did the same?

[Paul Lloyd][paul] will talk about what it means to design for a medium and create designs which work to the strengths of the medium rather than highlight the weaknesses.
