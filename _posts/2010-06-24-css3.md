<a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6558734/BRI/Hove/Async-Using-CSS3-Transitions-amp-Animations/The-Werks">Please add yourself to the event on Upcoming</a>

This session, led by <a href="http://twitter.com/aroncarroll">Aron Carroll</a>, will explore the use of CSS transitions and animations as an alternative to traditional JavaScript methods. Although animations are still just a proposed part of the CSS3 spec, enough browsers have now added support that it is worth considering them a tool for use in your projects.

The talk will cover implementation of CSS animations in both CSS and JavaScript, browser coverage, progressive enhancement for unsupported browsers and a look into current limitations of the specification. Having some knowledge of both CSS and JavaScript will be useful but should not be necessary to follow the talk.

<strong>Bring a laptop, if you want to hack along with the session.</strong>

Aron currently lives and works in Brighton as a Web Developer for a Mac software company where he builds and maintains their web applications.
