Amazon tutorials will help you make your first Hello World/Alexa app, but what then? Building a Voice User Interface raises questions that will apply to any app build. Jez will take you on a lightning tour of what he has learned so far. There will be slides+talk, there will be activities, there will be live(ish) coding. You should leave the session with an idea of how Alexa works and what a real-life project might involve..

This meetup will be sponsored by [Creative Technologies](https://www.creative-technologies.co.uk), so beers and pizzas for all! If you have any dietary requirements, please get in touch at hello AT asyncjs DOT com.
