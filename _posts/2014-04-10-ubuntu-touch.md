Fast, secure and stylishly simple, the [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) operating system is used by millions of people worldwide every day.

In this talk Alan Pope (Engineering Manager at Canonical) will show the Ubuntu SDK and how easy it is to create applications for phone, tablet and desktop.

We'll look at the tools, how to get setup and how to get an app into the Ubuntu Store in minutes.

The talk is aimed at people who have never developed for Ubuntu before.

There are no real pre-requsites, we'll go at the pace of the room and there should be plenty of time for Q&A.
