It's nearing the end of the year - everyone's busy buying presents, and organizing to see friends and family for the holidays. So we thought we'd take it easy and have a social event where we can all relax and enjoy each other's company.

If you're familiar with [JavaScript Brighton](https://www.meetup.com/javascript-brighton/), this event will be much like one of their usual events, but with free üçï pizza and üçª drinks! ü•≥

We'll start off at our usual venue - [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship) where food/drinks will be provided, and everyone can get together to socialize and optionally show off any projects they've been working on. You don't have to show anything off, but we'd recommend bringing along a laptop/tablet (or any other device your thing runs on) if you've got something you're proud of or you think people will enjoy.

After an hour or two we'll move to a nearby pub (probably [Unbarred](https://www.unbarredbrewery.com/)) for a few more drinks, opportunity to chat some more, and see where the night takes us.

You will be able to join us in-person at [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship). This event will not be live streamed.

üçï Pizza and üçª drinks will be provided thanks to sponsorship from [Runway East](https://runwayea.st/locations/brighton?utm_source=external&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=sponsorship) and [Silicon Brighton](https://siliconbrighton.com/).

As always we welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along. It's a great opportunity for anyone looking to get into the industry to meet people already in it, ask for advice, and get to know the community.
