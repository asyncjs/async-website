Component libraries, pattern portfolios, styleguides.... whatever you want to call them, using a modular design and build approach to developing sites and web apps is fast becoming an accepted best practice. But working in this way often comes with its own share of difficulties and pain points, particularly when it comes to integrating component libraries with production code.

In this talk Mark will look at some common issues that can crop up, how they might be avoided, and introduce a tool that they have been using internally at Clearleft to help mitigate some of these problems.

You won't need to bring any technical knowledge to the talk - anyone with a bit of general front-end dev experience should feel right at home.

# About Mark:

Mark is a front-end developer at Clearleft where he spends his time split between building sites and component libraries for clients, and developing in-house tools.
