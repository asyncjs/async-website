We've had two Ask the Online Brains sessions since the start of this pandemic, and it's time for what will hopefully be our last one where we're all joining from our kitchen tables/bedrooms/shepherd's huts.

If you haven't joined one before, don't worry they're super easy to get involved in at any level that's most comfortable for you.

Inspired by the monthly Brighton ALT.NET meetup (http://brightonalt.net/), we will be asking/talking/ranting about everything web-related - 5 - 10 minutes per topic.

The aim is to create a friendly environment for everyone to ask their "that thing you've never understood but always been too afraid to ask" type questions, plus any other topics you feel like talking about on the night. Topics such as:

- I'm new to development. Where do I get started?
- I still don't get it! What the hell does "this" mean in JavaScript?
- null or undefined, or is there a case for both
- Do we have to accept that JavaScript is now a compiled language
- How do you maintain a work-life balance
- Should I write unit tests, integration tests, or both?
- What are the beneficial aspects of Agile/Scrum, and what do you find less useful.

You will be able to submit topics, and event attendees will be able to vote for the topics they would like to discuss. We will run the online discussion for about an hour, and afterwards, anyone who wishes to stay can share a virtual pint.

The format works best when there is a diverse group of people and opinions in the room, so whether you consider yourself an absolute beginner or a seasoned pro, do come and join.

So, please put your thinking caps on now and start thinking of some questions you would like to ask.

***

The Zoom will be open from 7.30pm so please feel free to join early and have a general catch up :)
