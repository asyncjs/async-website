Welcome back for another Async Christmas Quiz! Despite all the challenges, it’s been a great year in Async-land, with great talks on everything from Accessibility to React Native, as well as some cracking community events such as Ask the Brains and the Show’n’Tell.

Come join us to round it off in style with Quizmaster Daniel van Berzon. As with last year, this will not be a test of how much JavaScript you know as we want to welcome people at all stages of their career; instead it’ll be more of a pub-style quiz but with the focus on having a great time together. So get your metaphorical (or real) Santa hat and beard on and sign up!
