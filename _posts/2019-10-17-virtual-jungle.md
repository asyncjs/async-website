Come along to the Async [BDF](https://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/) Special to help create an immersive augmented-reality jungle scene which you can view directly on your phone's web browser!

Whether your want to try your hand at creating 3D models of the Jungle's denizens using Virtual Reality, bring them to life through web technologies such as [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) and [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js), or help craft the arts & crafts jungle background, we could use your skills!

Brighton-based [Mnemoscene.io](https://mnemoscene.io) will be on hand to coach us through the use of VR headsets to create models in [Google Blocks](https://vr.google.com/blocks/) and view them in [Tilt Brush](https://www.tiltbrush.com/) scenes. There will also be an A-Frame workshop to learn how to view your creations using open source "WebXR" technology.

This meetup be sponsored by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/), so beers and pizzas for all! If you have any dietary requirements, please get in touch at hello AT asyncjs DOT com.
