[HAPI][hapi] is a node.js framework designed to provide the perfect foundation for APIs. It has a simple to use configuration-centric design with built-in support for input validation, caching, authentication, and other essential features. HAPI provides a painless route to scalable architecture allowing you to spend more time writing reusable application code instead of building API scaffolding.

In this talk you will learn why it is worth considering dropping Express.js for HAPI if you are building APIs. Glenn will cover how to use HAPI and how to extend the framework to make your APIs self-documenting.

[Glenn Jones][glenn] is a Brighton based web developer and designer who has spoken about JavaScript at a number of conferences such as [Full Frontal][ff].
