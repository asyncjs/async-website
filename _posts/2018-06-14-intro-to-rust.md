Rust is a new language developed by Mozilla which takes an interesting approach to memory management and memory safety. We'll be taking a look at Rust's "big idea" and the thing that makes it unique; ownership and borrowing. This language level feature forms the cornerstone of Rust and is a common source of trouble for people picking up the language.

We'll take a brief look at how to get started with Rust before diving into some very simple code examples that introduce the core language, drawing special attention to the mechanics of ownership and borrowing.

## UPDATE:

This meetup will now be sponsored by [Brandwatch](http://www.brandwatch.com), so beers and pizzas for all! If you have any dietary requirements, please get in touch at <a href="mailto:hello@asyncjs.com">hello@asyncjs.com</a>
