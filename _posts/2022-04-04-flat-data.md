Flat explores how to make it easy to work with data in git and GitHub. It builds on the [“git scraping” approach pioneered by Simon Willison][simon-willison] to offer a simple pattern for bringing working datasets into your repositories and versioning them, because developing against local datasets is faster and easier than working with data over the wire.

The team at GitHub Next is focused on enabling new developer workflows. They'll walk through how their [Flat Data project][flat-data] makes it easy to bring data from anywhere on the web directly into your own repos for processing, analyzing, and versioning.

Talk starts at 7.45pm UK time, but the zoom will be open from 7.30pm so feel free to join early for a chinwag.
