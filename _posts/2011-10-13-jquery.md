<p><a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> is so ubiquitous, it almost blends in these days. It seems to be part of every designer and coder's toolset.</p>

<p>Whilst many may be used to jQuery's online forums and gatherings as the means of interacting with other jQuery users, there isn't currently a face-to-face meetup focussing on jQuery in digital Brighton. So, a few weeks ago, whilst at the <a href="http://brightonfarm.com">Brighton Farm</a>, I mooted the idea of a jQuery user forum for Brighton. The idea got a positive reception and, with the good folk here at Async, we thought we would get the ball rolling and find out what kind of sessions people would be interested in.</p>

<p>And so, to kick off, <span class="summary">everyone is invited to come and tell us about their favourite jQuery plugin. We'll bring up each plugin's website on screen and discuss what it does and why it's useful.</span> We thought this would be a good ice-breaker and could introduce some concepts for further exploration in future sessions.</p>
 
<p>In particular, we would like to invite those who would class themselves as a <em>'user'</em> of jQuery and not necessarily a programmer. jQuery might be your first foray into the world of code beyond HTML and that's great! I myself, as more of a PHP dev, would not profess to be a jQuery expert and probably fall more into the <em>user</em> category. I hope to gain as much as everyone from these sessions and we should be able to harness some of Brighton's evident talent for future indulgence and nourishment.</p>
 
<p>A little about me: I am currently working as a PHP developer on <a href="http://beta.bufvc.ac.uk">quite a large framework</a>, where I am also called upon to use some of my front-end skills to look after the "front end of the back end" and the odd front end bit of the public site. But mainly I am working with PHP using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial">Mercurial</a> version control. I also still tout about for whole site builds <a href="http://nubz.com">as a freelancer</a> where I get to combine jQuery with PHP to my heart's content...</p>
