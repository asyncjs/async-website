[D3.js][d3] is fast becoming the standard tool for producing HTML5 data visualisations. It is an incredibly powerful framework that allows nearly limitless flexibility in manipulating the visual appearance and structure of a web page. However, the learning curve for using it effectively is steep. 

To get you over the hill as quickly as possible, [Peter Passaro][peter] will introduce you to the primary source material for ideas behind D3: Leland Wilkinson's book [The Grammar of Graphics][gg]. This will give you a deeper sense of D3's design DNA, and save you from having to read a 700 page text on graphics theory to get it.

A few great tools for getting up to speed with D3 will be introduced. These will include [Vega][vega], a json based tool for describing visualisations simply for D3, [Tributary][tributary] a rapid prototyping environment for building D3 visualisations, as well as some of the D3 based charting frameworks that are now available. 


## Update: Do you want to learn D3 from scratch?

There will be a one-day workshop to learn how to build data visualisations with D3.js, [on 3rd July][d3-workshop] (repeated on [25 Sept][d3-workshop-sept]) at the [Lab for the Recently Possible][L4RP]. For details and tickets, see [L4RP.com/d3/][d3-workshop]
