A broad introduction to WebGL, from low level code (in JavaScript and shaders in GLSL), through various libraries, frameworks and APIs, to WebGL as mark-up (no coding needed â€“ full fat 3D for designers).

I will also cover why to use it (access the unimaginable power of the GPU, I won't mention the current state of Flash) and demo / show some real world sites that use WebGL.

I'll run through some hands-on coding examples covering raw WebGL and an API (Three.js or Babylon.js).

This talk is aimed at anyone interested in JS, 3D or GPU programming on the web.

About Carl: I'm a software engineer (desktop and web), code-head and self-appointed WebGL evangelist. I *really* like 3D graphics... and maths.
