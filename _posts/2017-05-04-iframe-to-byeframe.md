iFrames are a quick and easy way to put content on other people’s websites, but not without their many drawbacks. James and Andy, the front end team from StoryStream, explain how they replaced iFrames with plain old JavaScript to seamlessly inject content into any website in the world, and detail the challenges they overcame along the way.

We’ll be discussing our approach in some detail but you’ll only need a general knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS to enjoy and understand it. Ideally, you’ll also dislike iFrames to develop with as much as we do.
