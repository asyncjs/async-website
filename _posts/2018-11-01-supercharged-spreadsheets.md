We all know the struggle, when a feature request sounds like the perfect job for a spreadsheet. But... there's always a tiny detail that makes us believe it's not quite enough to do the job. Or is it? In this talk, Tibor Besze will demonstrate how to utilise Google Apps Scripts (and a wide variety of Google services and APIs) to get the most out of your Google Sheets. The talk is aimed at Javascript developers of all skill levels, and includes a live demonstration.

## UPDATE:

This meetup will now be sponsored by [Brandwatch](http://www.brandwatch.com), so beers and pizzas for all! If you have any dietary requirements, please get in touch at <a href="mailto:hello@asyncjs.com">hello@asyncjs.com</a>
