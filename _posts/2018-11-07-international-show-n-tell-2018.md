The November migration of the world's top web developers to the sunny city of Brighton &amp; Hove can only mean one thing - [FFConf 2018][ff] is coming. So, it's time for another **International Async Show'n'tell**! This year's instalment will be _on Wednesday 7th November_ - not Thursday. The ever popular International show'n'tell is the perfect opportunity to give a peek at your passion project, try out a lightning talk, or just share what's on your mind.

_If you’d like to grab a speaking slot_, you’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web. We hope to bring together a blend of local projects with those from travellers to England for the conference.

Speakers, please <a data-gist href="https://gist.github.com/larister/ab84a296acf8f6cc51e242ea40dd53ac">add a comment to the Speakers' Gist</a>.

For a spot of inspiration, take a look at our International Show n' Tells in [2017][showntell-2017], [2016][showntell-2016], [2015][showntell-2015], [2014][showntell-2014], [2013][showntell-2013], [2012][showntell-2012], [2011][showntell-2011] and [2010][showntell-2010].

## Important Notice:

For the Show'n'Tell we'll be back in our old venue of 68 Middle St, _not_ The Skiff

# Update:

This meetup will be sponsored by [Ocasta](https://ocasta.com), so drinks and pizzas for all! This session, all pizzas will be from [Purezza](http://purezza.co.uk/), so no need to let us know dietary requirements except for gluten free as they'll all be vegan/vegetarian :)
