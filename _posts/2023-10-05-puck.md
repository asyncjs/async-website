Puck is an open source website builder for React that is being built at [Measured](https://measured.co). Puck aims to solve one of Measured's clients' primary pain points and put the WYSIWYG back into their content workflows, without breaking their brand.

Puck is self-hosted, lets you bring your own components and provides an easy drag-and-drop interface to build websites using your own components. You can integrate with an existing headless CMS or content repository, or choose to use it standalone as a micro-CMS.

Chris Villa - founder of Measured - will give us a brief run-through of why they built Puck, demo the user interface, and walk us through setting it up from scratch.
