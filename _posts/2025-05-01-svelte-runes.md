Svelte sports a reactive system that allied with a pre-compiler makes binding program variables to HTML elements pleasingly easy and concise. However there were some annoying edge cases that caused problems. Svelte 5 (aka Runes) fixes these using the Signals pattern. We’ll demonstrate these issues and how runes rides to the rescue. Finally we’ll cover the uptake of signals in the wider JavaScript ecosystem, including the latest TC39 standardisation.

Speaker: James Turner

James currently runs his own web-dev consultancy and has been building web-apps for longer that he cares to remember, having developed one of the first browser based FX trading systems (on IE6 no less!)
