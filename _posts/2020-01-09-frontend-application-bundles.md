For frontend developers, it feels like the tools and platforms on offer have never been better. But dig a little deeper, and you'll see that while things are pretty rosy for statically-hosted apps, there's a rapid increase in complexity when adding server-side logic or rendering. In this talk, we'll look at how that manifests, what it means for each of your apps & the open-source landscape at large, and how a new project, Frontend Application Bundles or FABs, can help solve it.
