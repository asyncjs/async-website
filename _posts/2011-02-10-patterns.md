<p class="summary">There are many challenges to developing a streamlined JavaScript application and, depending on the type of app being created, there may be bottlenecks to its performance. It is important to understand which kinds of bottleneck can apply in any given situation and focus time on addressing them, instead of less critical issues.</p>

<p>For example, a data visualisation will require different optimisations to an embedded widget, which will have different requirements to a more typical, progressively enhanced web page.</p>

<p>In this session with <a href="http://twitter.com/premasagar">Premasagar Rose</a>, we'll look at a number of techniques that you can start using in your application development straight away. Feel free to come with an example application in mind, and we'll explore which patterns might help its performance.</p>

<p><a href="http://premasagar.com">Prem</a> runs the Brighton-based company <a href="http://dharmafly.com">Dharmafly</a>, who create social web applications. He founded <a href="http://asyncjs.com">Async</a> in 2010 to help nurture the local community of JavaScript developers.</p>
