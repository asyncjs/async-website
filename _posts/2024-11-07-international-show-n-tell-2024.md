The November migration of the world's top web developers to the sunny city of Brighton & Hove can only mean one thing - [ffconf 2024](https://2024.ffconf.org/) is coming. So, it's time for another International Async Show n' tell! This year's installment will be _on Thursday 7th November_.

If you're interested in giving a talk, we'd love to hear from you. It's the perfect opportunity to give a peek at your passion project, try out a lightning talk, or just share what's on your mind. You‚Äôll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something‚Ä¶ a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web.

If you would like to grab a speaking slot, please leave a comment on the [meetup event][meetup] including:

- Your name
- Your main website, if you have one
- Where to find you on the socials
- A sentence or two about your talk
- Any relevant links

We only have time for so many speakers, so if you'd like to secure a slot (and a free drink) please leave your details on the [meetup event][meetup] - first come, first served. If on the day you feel like showing something off, we may have additional time due to cancellations, but we cannot guarantee it.
