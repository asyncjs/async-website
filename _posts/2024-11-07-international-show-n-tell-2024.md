The November migration of the world's top web developers to the sunny city of Brighton & Hove can only mean one thing - [ffconf 2024](https://2024.ffconf.org/) is coming. So, it's time for another International Async Show n' tell! This year's installment will be _on Thursday 7th November_.

If you're interested in giving a talk, we'd love to hear from you. It's the perfect opportunity to give a peek at your passion project, try out a lightning talk, or just share what's on your mind. You’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web.

If you would like to grab a speaking slot, please leave a comment on the [meetup event][meetup] including:

- Your name
- Your main website, if you have one
- Where to find you on the socials
- A sentence or two about your talk
- Any relevant links

You will be able to join us in-person in Brighton (venue TBC) or online (link added closer to the event).

As always we welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along.
