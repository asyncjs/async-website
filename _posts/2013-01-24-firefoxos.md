Early last year, [Mozilla][mozilla] decided to get into the phone business. This year, [FirefoxOS][firefoxos] is being put onto real devices that will be put in the hands of real people.

FirefoxOS is an operating system built out of [Linux][linux] and [Gecko][gecko], the rendering engine in [Firefox][firefox].

This is where Web meets Native and are one and the same.

Come to this talk to hear why people are paying attention to FirefoxOS, what it can do for you and how it has the potential to change the world.

[James Hugman][james] has been writing software for phones for 4 years. He now works at Mozilla, at the intersection between FirefoxOS and [Android][android], happy to be writing open source software for a living.
