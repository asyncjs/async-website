<p class="summary">The <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> browser now has over 120 million active users. Developers can reach those users via Chrome's facilities for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/">browser extensions</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/more/webstore.html">installable web apps</a>, which are the subject of this Async session by Google's own <a href="http://twitter.com/mahemoff">Michael Mahemoff</a>.</p>

<p>We'll start with extensions, learning how to add new controls to the browser and provide new ways for users to interact with web pages. Then we'll move on to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a> and see how to publish a "Hello World" web app that users can find in the Web Store and install into their browser.</p>

<p><a href="http://mahemoff.com">Michael Mahemoff</a> got started with JavaScript in the '90s and promptly rode the rising wave of Ajax in 2005, blogging at <a href="http://ajaxian.com">Ajaxian.com</a> and authoring <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596101800/">Ajax Design Patterns</a> for O'Reilly. He's now a Developer Advocate for Google, where he supports web developers in their efforts to use HTML5 and the Chrome APIs.</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>
<p>Mike has put his <a href="http://prez.mahemoff.com/async-chrome">slides online</a> and <a href="http://softwareas.com/asyncjs-talk-on-chrome-extensions-and-chrome-web-store">blogged about the event</a>.</p>
