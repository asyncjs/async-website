<p class="summary">You can now render 3D in JavaScript in the browser. <a href="http://sebleedelisle.com">Seb Lee-Delisle</a> will show you how to get started with the powerful and complex engine <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js">Three.js</a>, made by <a href="http://mrdoob.com">Mr.Doob</a> and his team.</p>

<p>We'll also discuss the future of in-browser 3D and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a>, to explore how realistic it is to use these capabilities in production.</p>

<p>Seb recently gave an Async session on JavaScript <a href="http://asyncjs.com/flash/">tricks and techniques from Flash</a>. He is one of the founders of the successful animation house, <a href="http://www.pluginmedia.net">Plug-in Media</a>.</p>
