[Ed Silverton](https://twitter.com/edsilv) will be presenting some of the [WebAR](https://createwebvr.com/webAR.html) work he has been doing at [Mnemoscene](http://mnemoscene.io/), followed by a coding workshop to introduce some of the basic concepts, including how to use GLTF objects, custom markers, and animation. This workshop is suitable for beginners and experienced web developers with an interest in learning [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).
