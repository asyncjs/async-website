It’s that time of year again in Brighton. It's the [Full Frontal][ff] conference on 8th November and, as ever, Async is here to get the ball rolling and the blood flowing.

This is [Async's][async] **2013 International Show n' Tell**. 

If you'd like to attend, just [sign up on the Lanyrd event page][event-lanyrd].

And, _if you’d like to grab a speaking slot_, you’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web. We hope to bring together a blend of local projects with those from travellers to England for the conference.

Speakers, please [add a comment to the Speakers' Gist][speakers], and we'll be in touch to confirm.

For a spot of inspiration, take a look at our International Show n' Tells in [2012][showntell-2012], [2011][showntell-2011] and [2010][showntell-2010]. We've also hosted local show n' tells: [1][birthday-2], [2][birthday-1], [3][showntell-2], [4][showntell-1].
