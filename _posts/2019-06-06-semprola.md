Most programming languages are built on ideas that were developed in the 1950s and 1960s and yet a lot about how we use computers has changed since then. Brighton local Oli Sharpe has been researching ideas about how one would build a contemporary programming language given how we use computers today. 

[Semprola](https://www.shift-society.org/salon/papers/2018/revised/semprola.pdf) is the programming language he is developing as a result of this research. The Async talk will first give a brief overview of the thinking behind the ideas of Semprola, a language in which you work with semiotic signs in contexts rather than symbols in text files. Then there will be a brief demo of where Semprola is at today, followed by a short explanation of the way that Javascript is being used to create the (rudimentary!) integrated Semprola IDE.

This won't be a deep dive into the compiler (or VM!) but the audience will be assumed to have basic understanding of programming.

This meetup will be sponsored by [Creative Technologies](https://www.creative-technologies.co.uk), so beers and pizzas for all! If you have any dietary requirements, please get in touch at hello AT asyncjs DOT com.
