We are extremely chuffed and humbled to have been given a sponsorship by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">The Guardian</a>, one of the most widely news sites on the Web. The newspaper is unique in being <em>not-for-profit</em>, at the forefront of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/data">global data journalism</a> and by supporting developer partnerships via its innovative <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform">Open Platform</a> service for embedded applications.

We plan to use the sponsorship contribution to cover the travel costs of speakers from beyond Brighton and to purchase useful titbits of equipment. Thank you to The Guardian for your heartfelt support.
