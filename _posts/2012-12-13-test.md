Come all, come one and marvel at the most splendid tests of messieurs [Parslow][tom] and [Elliott][simon]. GAZE as a multitude of testing approaches are considered for JavaScript. WONDER as in-browser testing is automated before your very eyes. GASP at numerous fantastical examples. DELIGHT at the options for testing your code. REVEL in the magic of [Mocha][mocha], [PhantomJS][phantom], [Sinon][sinon], [Chai][chai] and more.
