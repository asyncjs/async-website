Following the success of [Ask the Online Brains](https://asyncjs.com/ask-the-online-brains/), and with regular programming still suspended, we have decided to run an online version of another classic Async event. On Thurs 2nd July 2020 at 19:30 we are organising a __"Two dimensional Show and Tell"__.

This will be an online version of the [International show and tell][showntell-2019] that we run every year before [FFConf](https://ffconf.org/). It'll be a great opportunity to watch a variety of speakers each give a five-minute presentation on something exciting related to the web.

The meeting will be taking place on zoom, so please sign up to the event on [meetup.com][meetup] to get access to the link.

If you're interested in giving a talk, we'd love to hear from you. It's the perfect opportunity to give a peek at your passion project, try out a lightning talk, or just share what's on your mind. You’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web.

If you would like to grab a speaking slot, please leave a comment on the [meetup event][meetup] including:

- Your name
- Your main website, if you have one
- Twitter username, if you have one
- A sentence or two about your talk
- Any relevant links
