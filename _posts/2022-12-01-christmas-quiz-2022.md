Hold onto your (Santa) hats for a fresh instalment of the Async Christmas Quiz. Join us as we wind down for 2022’s final first-Thursday-of-the-month in festive December, and we reflect on another fabulous and varied year of Async meetups. This year join us in-person or follow along online.

As with previous years, this won’t be a test of how much JavaScript you know. It’s more like a traditional pub quiz that promises to be humbling at any stage of your career. Come one, come all for this earnest contest for the ultimate prize of trivial knowledge!
