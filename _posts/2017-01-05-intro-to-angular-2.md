Angular 2 is a complete rewrite of AngularJS (like a new language) and got to its full release of 2.0.0 in mid Sept 2016 after 2 years of going through alpha, beta and RC releases and has new bits added every week (now at 2.3.1 – 20/12/16).  Gordon Cumming is a Senior Angular/Angular 2 developer and has been studying Angular 2 for over 2 years although only started coding in Oct 2015. He lives and breathes Angular 2 on a daily basis (often 12 hours per day 7 days a week) and has written a 2000 page training application in Angular 2, all about Angular 2, with about 50 working applications within it to demonstrate different features.  This application has lots of show/hide sections so that the viewers don’t have too  much information on the screen at once.

Angular 2 is a complete framework (as is AngularJS) compared to ReactJS (only a library) and it has many more features, compared to these others.  It is complex due to its many parts, but on a basic level, easy to get things done (not difficult), once you’ve gone up a learning curve.  However there are of course more complex bits, which will take months or years of knowledge and experience to know about and master.  The number of times I’ve heard an expert? say “I hadn’t heard of that part of Angular 2 before!”  Some of these features will help improve the performance (load time or run time speed) or sometimes help reduce the size of your code (important for mobile devices).

In this talk Gordon will use slides and example coding to introduce you to Angular 2, show you what its main features are, compare it to AngularJS (Angular 1.x) and ReactJS, warn you about some pitfalls in learning Angular 2 and what the best way to get started with it is.  He will cover what it is, the main building blocks and features and how it caters for different platforms.
