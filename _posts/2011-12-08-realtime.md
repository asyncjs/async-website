<p><span class="summary">Over the last decade, we’ve seen a <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2009/07/the-pushbutton-web-realtime-becomes-real.html">fundamental shift</a> in the way the Web works.</span> Our users are becoming accustomed to seeing new content delivered immediately to the browser without refreshing the page. This has been possible for <a href="http://blog.pusher.com/2011/8/10/what-came-before-websockets">quite some time</a> but recently new APIs (<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/websockets/basics/">WebSockets</a> and <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/">Server-Sent Events</a>) have been introduced that make this simpler and more efficient.</p>

<p>In this talk, we’ll look at what the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_web">Realtime Web</a>” is, what you can use it for, and how it can increase user engagement. We’ll also look at the API for WebSockets as well as services that exist to allow you to easily add realtime functionality to your own existing products / services.</p>
