What's that? November already? Crikey, time for another **International Async Show'n'tell**! Following on from last year's success, [ffconf 2017][ff] will again be over two days, so to prevent clashing with the afterparties we'll be meeting *on Wednesday 8th November* - not Thursday. The International show'n'tell has become an institution in its own right, and is a perfect opportunity to give a peek at your passion project, try out a lightning talk, or just share what's on your mind.

And, _if you’d like to grab a speaking slot_, you’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web. We hope to bring together a blend of local projects with those from travellers to England for the conference.

Speakers, please <a data-gist href="https://gist.github.com/larister/f079111663031d4db0339f8e3f12b55f">add a comment to the Speakers' Gist</a>.

**Please Note**: This year, the venue has changed, and will now be at [The Skiff][theskiff]. See there me hearties.
