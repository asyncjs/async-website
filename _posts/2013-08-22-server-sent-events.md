Server-Sent Events (AKA `EventSource`) is a light-weight, HTTP-compatible alternative to WebSockets.

In this talk you'll learn the simple API and protocol for pushing events from Node or PHP to web browsers. This is the key to building pages that automagically update in real time (notifications, chat, collaborative editing, news tickers, twitter stream, etc.)
