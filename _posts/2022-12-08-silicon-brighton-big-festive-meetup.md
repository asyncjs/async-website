As the year draws to a close, Silicon Brighton is excited to host the Big Festive Meetup! This will be a super informal event to bring everyone together across all the meetups we support and celebrate the festive season. Catch up with friends youâ€™ve met through the year, meet new connections from different parts of the tech community, and make new contacts for the year ahead.

The first round is on Silicon Brighton and festive nibbles will be provided. ðŸ˜Š

**Dress code**: Festive jumpers optional (but very much encouraged!)
