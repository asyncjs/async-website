ðŸ•– **New start time!** From 2024 our events will start slightly earlier at 7.00pm

If you haven't heard of them, [codebar][codebar] runs free regular workshops to enable minority group members to learn programming in a safe and collaborative environment and expand their career opportunities. The atmosphere at each weekly codebar meeting is pretty special â€“ a great mix of catching-up, idea sharing and learning. They also run regular one-off events [codebar Festival][codebar-festival] and [uncodebar][uncodebar].

So much has happened since their last Async takeover in [2017][takeover]. Come down for an upbeat evening of code demos, stories and inspiration. If you have ever thought about becoming a student or volunteering to coach at codebar, get a glimpse at what they do and ask questions!
