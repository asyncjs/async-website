In which [Async][#async] and [Functional Brighton][#fbtn] join forces for a
night of functionality.

[Functional Programming][#fp] is an old paradigm with new interest that can
reduce complexity and create more reusable, provable, scalable and composable
programs. But what are the main features of functional programming? Why should
you be interested? And why now?

### The Evening's Speakers

[Kingsley Davies][#kingsley] will introduce the topic and the benefits of using
functional concepts both in JavaScript and in general.

[Tom Parslow][#tom] will walk us through some of the <em>functional
programming</em> techniques you can use in JavaScript and at the very helpful
[Underscore.js][#underscore] library's support for functional programming.

[Roy][#roy] is a new [statically typed][#statictype] functional language that
compiles to JavasScript. It's designed to help with correctness, while being
lightweight and working well with existing JavaScript code. [Richard
Dallaway][#richard] will reveal its beauty, its warts and all.
