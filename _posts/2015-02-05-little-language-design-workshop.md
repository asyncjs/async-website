A programming language and its tools shape the way we solve a given problem. Things trivially easy in one language can be a thicket of awful in another. Some languages need lots of boiler plate, some do not.

Growing a language: adding, removing and changing features is often difficult. The problems require not just computer science, but also aesthetics and taste.

My current side-project is a small mathematical programming language, called [Turo](http://turo.io).

It is an interesting project, and it is now time to add new language features.

When adding language features, there is a fun bit where we get to make up the language to write and think in.

The aim of this workshop is to give you a sense of this fun. Non-confrontational audience participation is expected.

Although very little of the code in this workshop will be Javascript, there is also a discussion about a number of Javascript tools to help you build your own little languages.
