Adapting change in technical architecture is the single most demanding but necessary consideration in modern applications. Modularity on the front-end is a familiar topic, but achieving this separation of concerns across a full stack poses a much greater challenge.

In this talk, Yann will be drawing from the concept of proxies, integrated in Node, to demonstrate an effective approach to strong abstraction across an end-to-end flow. In doing so, we're able to respond to change in an application architecture, maintaining modern conventions and increasing resilience against disasters.

New radical directions in our industry and our responsibility to develop accordingly was topical at the recent Full Frontal conference. Conversation to introduce these ideas at Async followed this [tweet](https://twitter.com/Aaunel/status/530748335356125184); it's definitely worth checking out the [talk Yann referred to](https://speakerdeck.com/henrikjoreteg/ffconf-dot-org).
