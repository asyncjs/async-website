Our next event will be the first held at what we hope to be our standard venue for the foreseeable future: [Spaces](https://www.spacesworks.com/brighton/trafalgar-place/) - just round the corner from our previous long standing venue.

As with our previous event you will be able to join us in-person, or online (via Zoom).

On Thursday the 7th of July we will be joined by Simon Downes of The Student Room Group who will be giving us a talk on how to level-up as a developer. One of a small few who can take any hat within a development department, be it from a technical level, all the way up to strategic leadership, Simon will explain how to progress a career within development, how you reach the next level, what skills developers need, both technical and soft, and how you can obtain or develop those skills.

As always we welcome people of all backgrounds and experience levels, so whether you've got a few years under your belt, or you're just starting to look into development we'd love to have you along.

If you're thinking of joining us in-person, please sign up to the event on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/async-web-tech-meetup/events/286855303/). We also highly recommend you sign up to the [Async Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/asyncjs/shared_invite/zt-1aguxx86q-XjF_yWcFoJ8fyYYzoqgDaQ) for more info, and updates.
