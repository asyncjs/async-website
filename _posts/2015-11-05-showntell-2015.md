Roll up folks, time for the annual **International Async Show'n'tell**! It's [ffconf][ff] (formerly known as Full Frontal conference) on 6th November, and as usual we'll be hosting a pre-conference special Async for Brightonians and pilgrims alike to show us what's getting their juices flowing right now.

If you'd like to attend, just [sign up on the Lanyrd event page][event-lanyrd].

And, _if you’d like to grab a speaking slot_, you’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web. We hope to bring together a blend of local projects with those from travellers to England for the conference.

Speakers, please <a data-gist href="https://gist.github.com/larister/3ca8fd3914fcf1eda75c">add a comment to the Speakers' Gist</a>.

For a spot of inspiration, take a look at our International Show n' Tells in [2014][showntell-2014] [2013][showntell-2013], [2012][showntell-2012], [2011][showntell-2011] and [2010][showntell-2010]. We've also hosted local show n' tells: [1][spring-2015] [2][birthday-4], [3][birthday-3], [4][birthday-2], [5][birthday-1], [6][showntell-2], [7][showntell-1].
