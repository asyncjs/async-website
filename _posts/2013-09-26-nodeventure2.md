Part of the [Brighton Digital Festival][bdf].

Come help create a multi-player [Text Adventure][ifiction]. We'll start with text and a storyline, and then add pictures to the scenes.

Non-programmers are welcome - we need ideas, words, artwork, design and all sorts of creativity...

And programmers - we'll be using JavaScript and Node.js, so come and lend your loops to the task.

This a chance to work with others on a creative group project. There are two sessions: [12th Sept][12-sept] and [26th Sept][26-sept]. Feel free to come to both or either.

WRITERS: Write inspiring descriptions of rooms, items and beings...  
ARTISTS: Bring beauty to the world...  
PROGRAMMERS: Extend our super simple game engine; maybe add interactions between players and other niceties.  
EVERYONE: Help us create a new world!
