This will be an introduction to some of the concepts and techniques used in functional programming - and how, when utilised, they can create more readable and testable code.

We'll be focusing on the currying and composition of functions to build up an application and touching on utility functions, the importance of argument order and other such goodies!

My name's Fabien, I work on JS Bin at Left Logic in Brighton and I secretly like math more than I like code.
