What's this? Have we really barrelled through another year and got to that time again? It's the [Full Frontal][ff] conference on 7th November, so keeping with tradition we'll be having a Show'n'Tell for developers native to Brighton and those from further afield to take the stage.

This is [Async's][async] **2014 International Show n' Tell**. 

If you'd like to attend, just [sign up on the Lanyrd event page][event-lanyrd].

And, _if you’d like to grab a speaking slot_, you’ll have five minutes on the night to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web. We hope to bring together a blend of local projects with those from travellers to England for the conference.

Speakers, please <a data-gist href="https://gist.github.com/larister/6e4c8eefa093345a4d32">add a comment to the Speakers' Gist</a>.

For a spot of inspiration, take a look at our International Show n' Tells in [2013][showntell-2013], [2012][showntell-2012], [2011][showntell-2011] and [2010][showntell-2010]. We've also hosted local show n' tells: [1][birthday-4], [2][birthday-3], [3][birthday-2], [4][birthday-1], [5][showntell-2], [6][showntell-1].
