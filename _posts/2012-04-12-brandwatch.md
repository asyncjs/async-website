The very lovely [Brandwatch](http://www.brandwatch.com), a social
analytics company from Brighton, is sponsoring the [Async developer community](http://asyncjs.com) for the months of April and May!

We [recently posted](http://asyncjs.com/sponsor-us/) about wanting to
invest in our community and its activities, so our huge thanks go out to
Brandwatch for blazing the trail. The timing is perfect, since
Brandwatch's app falls under the scrutiny of [tonight's case study of JavaScript application architecture](http://asyncjs.com/architecture/).
And for budding JavaScripters,
the company have some excellent local job openings (see below).

<h3 class="clear">Who is Brandwatch?</h3>

__Brandwatch crawls the internet__, archiving over 50 million instances
of social media data every day. Users of the service can search via a
web interface for mentions of their brand or keyword, either past
mentions or to track future occurrences, using a sophisticated query
creation process. 

The Brandwatch app includes an advanced suite of features that allows
data to be chopped and sliced to provide insights, graphing,
categorisation, geolocation, metadata and countless other components. 

Understanding and monitoring a brand is just the start: Brandwatch also
lets people engage with the communities they have identified, responding
to, assigning workflow and managing social media mentions with ease.

Brandwatch is the perfect platform to make sense of the chatter about a
brand online.

### Jobs with Brandwatch
Brandwatch is recruiting JavaScript developers of all levels. They are
interested in people with a good understanding of OO principles and the MVC pattern, with a strong grasp of JavaScript
fundamentals.

TDD / BDD experience is a massive
plus, as is experience of contributing to open source projects. Some
commercial experience is essential for mid/senior roles, but they are
interested to hear from graduates (or soon-to-be-graduates) looking for
a junior role.
