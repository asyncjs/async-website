This weeks session will be a look into the world of JavaScript modules. There
are hundreds of solutions out there for structuring your JavaScript files and
getting them into the page.

The event is aimed at being a general round table discussion on the topic
so bring your own preferred solution as well as any questions or issues you'd
like to discuss. We'll have a few speakers doing very short presentations on
some of the more popular solutions.

- Script Loaders ([CommandJS][#cmd] and [YepNope][#yep])
- AMD Module ([RequireJS][#rqr])
- Build Tools ([Grunt][#gnt])
- Package Managers ([Ender][#edr])
