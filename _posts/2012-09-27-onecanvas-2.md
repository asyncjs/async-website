[![A Brighton Digital Festival event][#bdf-logo]][#bdf-onecanvas]

Following on from the blistering success of Async's "[JavaScript Jungle][#jj]" ([write-up][#jjblog]) at last year's [Brighton Digital Festival][#bdf], we'll be running another pair of "Hack Nights" this year, called "One Canvas" on the [13th][#onecanvas] and [27th][#onecanvas2] September.

We'll set up an infinitely scrollable and zoomable web page, where anyone can contribute a piece of digital art. Think generative computer graphics, tiny games, data-powered visualisations or anything interactive.

This is a fun, relaxed, no-experience-necessary event to learn and play with new technologies in the web browser, hook up with other local artists, designers and developers, and get together to make something beautiful and unique. We need artists and designers as much as JavaScript and other developers, so come along to either or both sessions, whoever you are. We'll put the whole anarchic burst of colour live when we're done.
