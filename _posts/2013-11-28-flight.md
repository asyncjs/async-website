The [FlightJS][flight] application framework offers a new way of building web applications at scale. Its straightfoward architecture allows the creation of highly portable, well-defined components that are easy to understand, easy to write and can be shared between applications.

In this talk, [Tom Hamshere][tbrd] will provide an overview of how you can use Flight to enhance existing applications and build new ones in minutes. It will cover:

* Designing components & applications
* Creating components
* Progressive enhancement of existing websites
* Mixins, an alternative to object-based inheritance
* The Yeoman Flight generator
* Using open-source Flight components

[Tom Hamshere][tbrd] is a Software Engineer at Twitter and was responsible for converting TweetDeck to use the Flight framework. He's the author of [Getting Started with Twitter Flight][gswtf] and blogs about TweetDeck and Flight at [SimpleButGood.net][simplebutgood]
