D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library for producing rich interactive data-driven visualizations for the web. The last few decades have seen an explosion of data; the challenge now is how to process and present that data in a human-readable way. As the plentiful examples at [d3js.org](https://d3js.org) and [blocks.org](https://bl.ocks.org) show, D3 is capable of some pretty impressive stuff! This talk assumes no previous knowledge of D3.JS but does assume basic familiarity with JavaScript or a similar programming language.
