So you’re a tech lead, developer or architect, you’ve got a massive application (or lots of smaller ones), a gambit of different user and business needs, long transactional journeys and different infrastructure locations.

You want technical consistency, a seamless user experience and for your fellow team members to able to pick up and understand the code wherever they are in the application.

How do you solve all of this?

In this talk James Gray, Solutions Architect and UI Practise Lead on the Criminal Justice System Common Platform explains their initial solutions, what they learnt, how they solved these issues and where they see the future. It will cover architecture, design, communication, code structure and just a sprinkle of delivery and team structure.
