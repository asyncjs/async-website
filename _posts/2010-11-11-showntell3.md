Async has hosted <em>JavaScript Show n' Tells</em> before (<a href="http://asyncjs.com/showntell/">one here</a> and <a href="http://asyncjs.com/showntell2/">one there</a>), but this one's a little special, because this time there'll be a boatload of international visitors in Brighton for the legendary <a href="http://2010.full-frontal.org/">Full Frontal conference</a>. So, on the evening before the conference, we'll be taking over the downstairs space at <a href="http://theskiff.org">The Skiff</a>, to hear <em>your</em> very special presentations.

You can show a pet project that you've been working on, or a brilliant JavaScript-based app that you've seen, or tell us about a clever little library that you've used, or anything else JS that you love. It's 5 minutes per presentation + 5 minutes questions (we might tweak this, depending on the number of people who want to speak).

It's completely free to attend, and you are welcome to just watch and not give a talk. <em>If you do</em> want to show n' tell something, please tell us about it. We're really keen to hear from any of our out-of-town visitors, so don't be shy!

After Async, everyone's invited to the Full Frontal pre-conference social, just around the corner at <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place?um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=brighton+Fountainhead&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=uk&amp;hq=Fountainhead&amp;hnear=Brighton,+East+Sussex&amp;cid=6619924646768301834">The Fountainhead</a>.
