With JavaScript becoming ubiquitous, the holy grail of writing code once and
running it everywhere is becoming more and more of a reality. Meteor attempts to
take it one step further.

[Meteor][Meteor] is an ultra-simple environment for building modern
real-time websites. What once took weeks, even with the best tools, now takes
hours with Meteor.

Meteor helps you to build real-time apps with the ease of writing simple client
side JavaScript.

In this talk, we will have a look at how you can build apps very quickly using
Meteor and why you should keep Meteor in your toolchain.

[Adhip][Adhip] is a programmer based out of the very lovely
[Skiff][Skiff] and spends most of his time building web and mobile
applications.
