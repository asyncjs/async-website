Event handling in JavaScript is a mess. Especially now since UIs are becoming more complex and are supposed to work on a range of devices. At the heart of [Functional Reactive Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOCCzDNsAtI) lies a simple and powerful concept that can help us keep sane: __The EventStream__.

With EventStreams we can treat Events like first class citizens in JavaScript. We can map, filter or merge them, compose new ones and reason about sequence.

Novice, or seasoned pro, this talk is aimed at anyone who wants to escape callback hell and enter a world where writing sophisticated user interfaces is doable, fun and exciting.
