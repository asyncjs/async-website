Git has pretty much taken over as the Version Control System of choice for modern
web developers, helped not in small part by the rise of [GitHub](https://github.com)

Most of you will be at least mildly comfortable using git, but there's a lot more to git than
`git pull origin master`.  What happens when you `git clone`? What's a remote? What's does a
rebase *do* exactly?

In this talk Steve Mason goes over the less-basic parts of git, and introduces you
to an improved git workflow that will have you harnessing the power of Git.
