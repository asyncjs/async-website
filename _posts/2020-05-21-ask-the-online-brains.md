What with one thing and another, and with regular programming suspended, we've decided to have a go at a virtual Async event.

On the evening of 21 May, we will be hosting on an online version of our popular __"Ask the Brains"__ event. Inspired by the monthly Brighton [ALT.NET meetup](http://brightonalt.net/), we will be asking/talking/ranting about everything web-related - 5 - 10 minutes per topic.

The aim is to create a friendly environment for everyone to ask their _"that thing you've never understood but always been too afraid to ask"_ type questions, plus any other topics you feel like talking about on the night. Topics such as:

- I'm new to development. Where do I get started?
- I still don't get it! What the hell does `this` mean in Javascript?
- `null` or `undefined`, or is there a case for both
- Do we have to accept that JavaScript is now a compiled language
- How do you maintain a work-life balance
- Should I write unit tests, integration tests, or both?
- What are the beneficial aspects of Agile/Scrum, and what do you find less useful.

You will be able to submit topics, and event attendees will be able to vote for the topics they would like to discuss. We will run the online discussion for about an hour, and afterwards, anyone who wishes to stay can share a virtual pint.

The format works best when there is a diverse group of people and opinions in the room, so whether you consider yourself an absolute beginner or a seasoned pro, do come and join.

So, please put your thinking caps on now and start thinking of some questions you would like to ask.

Please sign up to the event on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Async-Web-Tech-Meetup/events/270599931/). We also highly recommend you sign up to the Async Slack channel for more info, and updates.
