<p>
<span class="summary">In this Async session, <a href="http://twitter.com/jhugman">James Hugman</a> will introduce <a href="https://github.com/kirinjs/kirin">Kirin</a>, a new set of tools that helps making native mobile apps that are easier to port to multiple platforms.</span>
</p>

<p>The approach came as a reaction to the experience of working with both <a href="http://asyncjs.com/phonegap/">PhoneGap</a> and <a href="http://asyncjs.com/titanium/">Titanium</a> and was validated whilst building the award winning app for the 2011 Glastonbury Festival.</p>

<p>It has been greeted with interest and incredulity in both the iOS and Android developer communities, and this session will be the first outing of Kirin into the wider Javascript community.</p>

<p>This talk will be reasonably technical, though without a lot of code. If you have any interest in developing or commissioning mobile apps, then this talk will be for you.</p>

<p>James works at Brighton based <a href="http://www.futureplatforms.com">Future Platforms</a>. He leads one of the technical teams there, building phone apps with a wide breadth of technologies, including JavaScript and <a href="http://asyncjs.com/nodejs/">Node.js</a>.</p>
