[Angular][#angular] teaches your old browser new tricks. It is what HTML would
have been had it been designed for building web-applications.

Angular is radical because it eliminates boilerplate code with
[declarative][#declarative] rather than [imperative][#imperative] syntax.
Having an awesome framework is not enough; one needs to have easy testability,
since this is the easiest way to develop and maintain big apps. In this
session, we will focus on how AngularJS makes applications a joy to test and
look at how Angular compares to other web application toolkits, like
[Backbone][#backbone], [Ember][#ember] and [Knockout][#knockout].

[Vojta Jína][#vojta] is originally from the Czech Republic, and currently a
software engineer at Google, Mountain View. He is a big fan of [Test Driven
Development][#tdd] and open source projects. In free time, he really enjoys
music, especially playing trumpet and collects speeding tickets.
